        <h2 class="mb-4">Who the Heck Is T.Harv Eker?r, and Why Should
            I Read This Book?</h2>
        <p> People are shocked, at the beginning of my seminars, when
            one of the first things I tell them is “Don’t believe a word I
            say.” Why would I suggest that? Because I can only speak
            from my own experience. None of the concepts and insights I
            share are inherently true or false, right or wrong. They simply
            reflect my own results, and the amazing results I’ve seen in the
            lives of thousands and thousands of my students. Having said
            that, however, I believe that if you use the principles you learn
            in this book, you will totally transform your life. Don’t just
            read this book. Study it as if your life depended on it. Then try
            the principles out for yourself. Whatever works, keep doing.
            Whatever doesn’t, you’re welcome to throw away.</p>
        <p>I know I may be biased, but when it comes to money, this
            may be the most important book you have ever read. I understand that’s a bold statement, but the fact is,
            this book
            provides the missing link between your desire for success
            and your achievement of success. As you’ve probably found
            out by now, those are two different worlds</p>
        <p>No doubt you’ve read other books, listened to tapes or
            CDs, gone to courses, and learned about numerous get-rich
            systems be they in real estate, stocks, or business. But what
            happened? For most people, not much! They get a short blast
            of energy, and then it’s back to the status quo.</p>
            <p>
            Finally, there’s an answer. It’s simple, it’s law, and you’re
            not going to circumvent it. It all comes down to this: if your
            subconscious “financial blueprint” is not “set” for success,
            nothing you learn, nothing you know, and nothing you do will
            make much of a difference.</p>
            <p>
            In the pages of this book, we will demystify for you why
            some people are destined to be rich and others are destined for
            a life of struggle. You will understand the root causes of
            success, mediocrity, or financial failure and begin changing
            your financial future for the better. You will understand how
            childhood influences shape our financial blueprint and how
            these influences can lead to self-defeating thoughts and habits.
            You will experience powerful declarations that will help you
            replace your nonsupportive ways of thinking with mental
            “wealth files” so that you think—and succeed—just as rich
            people do. You will also learn practical, step-by-step strategies
            for increasing your income and building wealth.</p>
            <p>
            In Part I of this book, we will explain how each of us is
            conditioned to think and act when it comes to money, and
            outline four key strategies for revising our mental money
            blueprint. In Part II, we examine the differences between how
            rich, middle-class, and poor people think, and provide
            seventeen attitudes and actions to take that will lead to permanent changes in your financial life. Throughout the book
            we also share just a few examples of the thousands of letters
            and e-mails I’ve received from students who have attended the
            Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar and achieved powerful
            results in their lives.</p>
            <p>
            So what is my experience? Where am I coming from? Was I
            always successful? I wish!</p>
            <p>
            Like many of you, I supposedly had a lot of “potential” but
            had little to show for it. I read all the books, listened to all the
            tapes, and went to all the seminars. I really, really, really
            wanted to be successful. I don’t know whether it was for the
            money, the freedom, the sense of achievement, or just to
            prove I was good enough in my parents’ eyes, but I was almost
            obsessed with becoming a “success.” During my twenties, I
            started several different businesses, each with the dream of
            making my fortune, but my results went from dismal to worse.</p>
            <p>
            I worked my butt off but kept coming up short. I had
            “Loch Ness monster disease”: I had heard of this thing called
            profit, I just never saw any of it. I kept thinking, “If I just get
            into the right business, get on the right horse, I’ll make it.” But
            I was wrong. Nothing was working...at least for me. And it was
            the last part of that sentence that finally struck me. How come
            others were succeeding in the exact same business I was in and
            I was still broke? What happened to “Mr. Potential”?</p>
            <p>
            So I began doing some serious soul-searching. I examined
            my true beliefs and saw that even though I said I really wanted
            to be rich, I had some deep-rooted worries about it. Mostly I
            was afraid. Afraid that I might fail, or worse, succeed and then
            somehow lose it all. Then I’d really be a schmuck. Worse, I
            would blow the one thing I had going for
            4 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
            out I didn’t have what it took and I was destined to a life of
            struggle?</p>
            <p>
            Then, as luck would have it, I got some advice from an
            extremely rich friend of my father’s. He was at my parents’
            house playing cards with the “boys” and, in passing, noticed
            me. This was the third time I’d moved back home, and I was
            living in the “lower-level suite,” otherwise known as the
            basement. I suppose my dad had complained to him of my
            woeful existence because when he saw me, he had the sympathy in his eyes usually reserved for the bereaved at a funeral.
            He said, “Harv, I started in the same way as you, a complete
            disaster.” Great, I thought, this was making me feel a lot
            better. I should let him know that I was busy...watch-ing the
            paint peel off the wall.</p>
            <p>
            He kept going: “But then I got some advice that changed
            my life, and I’d like to pass it on to you.” Oh, no, here comes
            the father-son lecture, and he’s not even my father! Finally he
            came out with it: “Harv, if you’re not doing as well as you’d
            like, all that means is there’s something you don’t know.”
            Being a brash young man at the time, I thought I knew pretty
            well everything, but alas, my bank account said something
            different. So I finally began to listen. He continued, “Did you
            know that most rich people think in very similar ways?”</p>
            <p>
            I said, “No, I never really considered that.” To which he
            replied, “It’s not an exact science, but for the most part, rich
            people think a certain way and poor people think a completely
            different way, and those ways of thinking determine their
            actions and therefore determine their results.” He went on, “If
            you thought the way rich people do and did what
            rich people do, do you believe you could become rich too?” I
            remember answering with all the confidence of a mush ball, “I
            think so.” “Then,” he replied, “all you have to do is copy how
            rich people think.”</p>
            <p>
            Being the skeptic I was at the time, I said, “So what are you
            thinking right now?” To which he replied, “I’m thinking that
            rich people keep their commitments and mine is to your dad
            right now. The guys are waiting for me, see ya.” Although he
            walked out, what he said sank in.
            Nothing else was working in my life, so I figured what the
            heck and threw myself wholeheartedly into studying rich
            people and how they think. I learned everything I could about
            the inner workings of the mind, but concentrated primarily on
            the psychology of money and success. I discovered that it was
            true: rich people really do think differently from poor and even
            middle-class people. Eventually, I became aware of how my
            own thoughts were holding me back from wealth. More
            important, I learned several powerful techniques and strategies
            to actually recondition my mind so that I would think in the
            same ways rich people do.</p>
            <p>
            Finally, I said, “Enough yakking about it, let’s put it to the
            test.” I decided to attempt yet another business. Because I was
            really into health and exercise, I opened one of the first retail
            fitness stores in North America. I didn’t have any money, so I
            had to borrow $2,000 on my Visa card to get the business
            started. I began using what I’d learned by modeling rich
            people, both in terms of their business strategies and their
            thinking strategies. The first thing I did was commit to my
            success and playing to win. I swore I would focus and not
            even consider leaving this business until I was a millionaire or
            more. this was radically different from my previous efforts,
            where, because I always thought short-term, I would
            constantly get sidetracked by either good opportunities or
            when things got tough.</p>
            <p>
            I also began challenging my mental approach whenever I
            began thinking in financially negative or counterproductive
            ways. In the past, I believed that what my mind said was truth.
            I learned that in many ways, my mind was my biggest obstacle
            to success. I chose not to entertain thoughts that did not
            empower me toward my vision of wealth. I used every one of
            the principles you are going to learn in this book. Did it work?
            Boy, did it work!</p>
            <p>
            The business was so successful that I opened ten stores in
            only two and a half years. I then sold half the company shares
            to a Fortune 500 company for $1.6 million.</p>
            <p>
            After that, I moved to sunny San Diego. I took a couple of
            years off to refine my strategies and began doing one-on-one
            business consulting. I presume it was quite effective for people
            because they kept bringing friends, partners, and associates to
            our sessions. Soon I was coaching ten and sometimes twenty
            people at a time.</p>
            <p>
            One of my clients suggested that I might as well open up a
            school. I thought that was a great idea, so I did. I founded the
            Street Smart Business School and taught thousands of people
            all across North America “street-smart” business strategies for
            “high-speed” success.</p>
            <p>
            As I traveled across the continent giving my seminars, I
            noticed something strange: You could have two people sitting
            side by side in exactly the same room, learning exactly the
            same principles and strategies. One person would take these
            tools and skyrocket to success. But what do you think might
            happen to the person sitting right next to him or her? The
            answer is, not much!</p>
            <p>
            That’s when it became obvious that you can have the
            greatest “tools” in the world, but if you’ve got a tiny leak in
            your “toolbox” (I’m pointing to my head right now), you’ve
            got a problem. So I designed a program called the Millionaire
            Mind Intensive based on the inner game of money and
            success. When I combined the inner game (the toolbox) with
            the outer game (the tools), virtually everybody’s results went
            through the roof! So that’s what you’re going to learn in this
            book: how to master the inner game of money to win the
            game of money—how to think rich to get rich!</p>
            <p>
            People often ask me whether my success was a “one-shot
            deal” or whether it has continued. Let me put it this way:
            Using the exact principles I teach, I have now earned millions
            and millions of dollars and am a multimultimillionaire several
            times over. Virtually all my investments and business ventures
            seem to skyrocket! Some people tell me I have the “Midas
            touch,” where everything I get involved in turns to gold.
            They’re right, but what they may not realize is that having a
            Midas touch is simply another way of saying, having a
            “financial blueprint” set for success, which is exactly what you
            will have once you learn these principles and do this work.</p>
            <p>
            Early on during our Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar, I
            generally ask the audience, “How many of you came here to
            learn?” It’s a bit of a trick question because as author Josh
            Billings said, “It’s not what we don’t know that prevents us
            from succeeding; it’s what we know that just ain’t so that is our
            greatest obstacle.” This book is not as much about learning as
            it is about “unlearning”! It is essential you recognize how your
            old ways of thinking and acting have gotten you exactly where
            you are right now.</p>

            If you’re really rich and really happy, fine. But if you’re not,
            I invite you to consider some possibilities that may not
            8 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
            fit into your “box” of what you currently think is right or even
            appropriate for you.</p>
            <p>
            Even though I suggest that you “don’t believe a word I say”
            and want you to test these concepts out in your own life, I’m
            going to ask you to trust the ideas you are reading. Not
            because you know me personally, but because thousands and
            thousands of people have already changed their lives as a result
            of the principles in this book.</p>
            <p>
            Speaking of trust, it reminds me of one of my favorite stories. It’s about a man who is walking along a cliff and all of a
            sudden loses his balance, slips, and falls off. Fortunately, he
            has the presence of mind to grab on to the ledge, and he’s
            hanging there for dear life. He hangs and hangs and finally
            yells out, “Is there anybody up there who can help me?”
            There’s no answer. He keeps calling and calling, “Is there
            anybody up there who can help me?” Finally this big bellowing
            voice calls back, “This is God. I can help you. Just let go and
            trust.” Next thing you hear: “Is there anybody else up there
            who can help me?”</p>
            <p>
            The lesson is simple. If you want to move to a higher level
            of life, you have to be willing to let go of some of your old
            ways of thinking and being and adopt new ones. The results
            will eventually speak for themselves.</p>
