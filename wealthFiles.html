                            <p>If you want to create wealth, it is imperative that you believe
                                that you are at the steering wheel of your life, especially your
                                financial life. If you don’t believe this, then you must inherently believe that you
                                have little or no control over your life,
                                and therefore you have little or no control over your financial
                                success. That is not a rich attitude.</p>
                            <p>
                                Did you ever notice that it’s usually poor people who spend
                                a fortune playing the lottery? They actually believe their wealth
                                is going to come from someone picking their name out of a
                                hat. They spend Saturday night glued to the TV, excitedly
                                watching the draw, to see if wealth is going to “land” on them
                                this week.</p>
                            <p>
                                Sure, everyone wants to win the lottery, and even rich
                                people play for fun once in a while. But first, they don’t spend
                                half their paycheck on tickets, and second, winning the lotto is
                                not their primary “strategy” for creating wealth.</p>
                            <p>
                                You have to believe that you are the one who creates your
                                success, that you are the one who creates your mediocrity, and
                                that you are the one creating your struggle around money and
                                success. Consciously or unconsciously, it’s still you.</p>
                            <p>
                                Instead of taking responsibility for what’s going on in their
                                lives, poor people choose to play the role of the victim. A
                                victim’s predominant thought is often “poor me.” So presto,
                                by virtue of the law of intention, that’s literally what victims
                                get: they get to be “poor.”</p>
                            <p>
                                Notice that I said they play the role of victim. I didn’t say
                                they are victims. I don’t believe anyone is a victim. I believe
                                people play the victim because they think it gets them something. We’ll discuss this in
                                more detail shortly.</p>
                            <p>
                                That said, how can you tell when people are playing the
                                victim? They leave three obvious clues.</p>
                            <p>
                                Now, before we talk about these clues, I want you to realize
                                that I fully understand that none of these ways of being has
                                anything to do with anyone reading this book. But maybe, just
                                maybe, you might know someone who can relate. And maybe,
                                just maybe, you might know that person intimately! Either
                                way, I suggest you pay close attention to this section.</p>
                            <h3>Victim Clue #1: Blame</h3>
                            <p>
                                When it comes to why they’re not rich, most victims are
                                professionals at the “blame game.” The object of this game is
                                to see how many people and circumstances you can point the
                                finger at without ever looking at yourself. It’s fun for victims
                                at least. Unfortunately it’s not such a blast for anyone else who
                                is unlucky enough to be around them. That’s because those in
                                close proximity to victims become easy targets.</p>
                            <p>
                                Victims blame the economy, they blame the government,
                                they blame the stock market, they blame their broker, they
                                blame their type of business, they blame their employer, they
                                blame their employees, they blame their manager, they blame
                                the head office, they blame their up-line or their down-line,
                                they blame customer service, they blame the shipping
                                department, they blame their partner, they blame their spouse,
                                they blame God, and of course they always blame their
                                parents. It’s always someone else or something else that is to
                                blame. The problem is anything or anyone but them.</p>
                            <h3>Victim Clue #2: Justifying</h3>
                            <p>
                                If victims aren’t blaming, you’ll often find them justifying or
                                rationalizing their situation by saying something like “Money’s
                                not really important.” Let me ask you this question: If you said
                                that your husband or your wife, or your boyfriend or your
                                girlfriend, or your partner or your friend, weren’t all that
                                important, would any of them be around for long? I don’t
                                think so, and neither would money!</p>
                            <p>
                                At my live seminars, some participants always come up to
                                me and say, “You know, Harv, money’s not really that important.” I look them directly in
                                the eyes and say, “You’re
                                broke! Right?” They usually look down at their feet and
                                meekly reply with something like “Well, right now I’m having
                                a few financial challenges, but . . .” I interrupt, “No, it’s not
                                just right now, it’s always; you’ve always been broke or close to
                                it, yes or yes?” At this point they usually nod their head in
                                agreement and woefully return to their seats, ready to listen
                                and learn, as they finally realize what a disastrous effect this
                                one belief has had on their lives.</p>
                            <p>
                                Of course they’re broke. Would you have a motorcycle if it
                                wasn’t important to you? Of course not. Would you have a pet
                                parrot if it wasn’t important to you? Of course not. In the
                                same way, if you don’t think money is important, you simply
                                won’t have any.</p>
                            <p>
                                You can actually dazzle your friends with this insight.
                                Imagine you’re in a conversation with a friend who tells you,
                                “Money’s not important.” Put your hand on your forehead
                                and look up as though you are getting a message from the
                                heavens, then exclaim, “You’re broke!” To which your
                                shocked friend will undoubtedly respond, “How did you
                                know?” Then you stretch out your palm and you reply,<br>
                                “What else do you want to know? That’ll be fifty bucks,
                                please!”</p>
                            <p>
                                Let me put it bluntly: anyone who says money isn’t important doesn’t have any! Rich
                                people understand the importance of money and the place it has in our society. On the
                                other hand, poor people validate their financial ineptitude by
                                using irrelevant comparisons. They’ll argue, “Well, money isn’t
                                as important as love.” Now, is that comparison dumb or what?
                                What’s more important, your arm or your leg? Maybe they’re
                                both important.</p>
                            <p>
                                Listen up, my friends: Money is extremely important in the
                                areas in which it works, and extremely unimportant in the
                                areas in which it doesn’t. And although love may make the
                                world go round, it sure doesn’t pay for the building of any
                                hospitals, churches, or homes. It also doesn’t feed anybody.</p>

                                sure? Then pop on over to the bank and try depositing some

                                money’s not important, then I have only two words for you,
                                you’re broke, and you always will be until you eradicate that
                                nonsupportive file from your financial blueprint.</p>
                            <h3>Victim Clue #3: Complaining</h3>
                            <p>
                                Complaining is the absolute worst possible thing you could do
                                for your health or your wealth. The worst! Why?</p>
                            <p>
                                I’m a big believer in the universal law that states, “What you
                                focus on expands.” When you are complaining, what are you
                                focusing on, what’s right with your life or what’s wrong with
                                it? You are obviously focusing on what’s wrong with it, and
                                since what you focus on expands, you’ll keep getting more of
                                what’s wrong.</p>
                            <p>
                                Many teachers in the personal development field talk about
                                the Law of Attraction. It states that “like attracts like,”
                                meaning that when you are complaining, you are actually attracting “crap” into your
                                life.</p>
                            <div class="card border-info mb-3 mx-0 mx-md-3 mx-lg-5">
                                <div class="card-header">WEALTH PRINCIPLE</div>

                                    <h4 class="card-title">When you are complaining, you become a living,
                                        breathing “crap magnet.”</h4>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>Have you ever noticed that complainers usually have a
                                tough life? It seems that everything that could go wrong does
                                go wrong for them. They say, “Of course I complain— look
                                how crappy my life is.” And now that you know better, you
                                can explain to them, “No, it’s because you complain that your
                                life is so crappy. Shut up... and don’t stand near me!”</p>
                            <p>
                                Which brings us to another point. You have to make darn
                                sure not to put yourself in the proximity of complainers. If you
                                absolutely have to be nearby, make sure you bring a steel
                                umbrella or the crap meant for them will get you too!</p>
                            <p>
                                I stay as far away from complainers as possible because
                                negative energy is infectious. Plenty of people, however, love
                                to hang out and listen to complainers. Why? It’s simple: they’re
                                waiting for their turn! “You think that’s bad? Wait till you hear
                                what happened to me!”</p>
                            <p>
                                Here’s some homework that I promise will change your life.
                                For the next seven days, I challenge you to not complain at all.
                                Not just out loud, but in your head as well. But you have to do
                                it for the full seven days. Why? Because for the first few days,
                                you may still have some “residual crap” coming to you from
                                before. Unfortunately, crap doesn’t travel at the speed of light,
                                you know, it travels at the speed of crap, so it might take a
                                while to clear out.</p>
                            <p>
                                I’ve given this challenge to thousands of people, and I’m
                                blown away at how many of them have told me that this one,
                                teensy-weensy exercise has transformed their lives. I guarantee
                                you’ll be astonished at how amazing your life will be when you
                                stop focusing on—and thereby stop attracting—crap into your
                                life. If you’ve been a complainer, forget about attracting
                                success for now; for most people, just getting to “neutral”
                                would be a great start!</p>
                            <p>
                                Blame, justification, and complaining are like pills. They are
                                nothing more than stress reducers. They alleviate the stress of
                                failure. Think about it. If a person weren’t failing in some way,
                                shape, or form, would he or she need to blame, justify, or
                                complain? The obvious answer is no.</p>
                            <p>
                                From now on, as you hear yourself disastrously blaming,
                                justifying, or complaining, cease and desist immediately. Remind yourself that you are
                                creating your life and that at every
                                moment you will be attracting either success or crap into your
                                life. It is imperative you choose your thoughts and words
                                wisely!</p>
                            <p>
                                Now you’re ready to hear one of the greatest secrets in the
                                world. Are you ready? Read this carefully: There is no such

                                thing as a really rich victim! Did you get that? I’ll say it again:
                                There is no such thing as a really rich victim. Besides, who
                                would listen? “Tsk, tsk, I got a scratch in my yacht.” To which
                                almost anyone would respond, “Who gives a hoot?”</p>

                                Meanwhile, being a victim definitely has its rewards. What
                                do people get out of being a victim? The answer is attention. Is
                                attention important? You bet it is. In some form or another
                                it’s what almost everyone lives for. And the reason people live
                                for attention is that they’ve made a critical mistake. It is the
                                same error that virtually all of us have made. We’ve confused
                                attention with love.</p>
                            <p>
                                Believe me, it is virtually impossible to be truly happy and
                                successful when you’re constantly yearning for attention. Because if it’s attention you
                                want, you’re at the mercy of others.
                                You usually end up as a “people pleaser” begging for approval.
                                Attention-seeking is also a problem because people tend to do
                                stupid things to get it. It is imperative to “unhook” attention
                                and love, for a number of reasons.</p>
                            <p>
                                First, you will be more successful; second, you will be happier; and third, you can find
                                “true” love in your life. For the
                                most part, when people confuse love and attention, they don’t
                                love each other in the true spiritual sense of the word. They
                                love each other largely from the place of their own ego, as in
                                “I love what you do for me.” Therefore, the relationship is
                                really about the individual, and not about the other person or
                                at least the both of you.</p>
                            <p>
                                By disconnecting attention from love, you will be freed
                                up to love another for who they are, rather than what they do
                                for you.</p>
                            <p>
                                Now, as I said, there is no such thing as a rich victim. So to
                                stay a victim, attention seekers make darn sure they never get
                                rich.</p>
                            <p>
                                It’s time to decide. You can be a victim or you can be rich,
                                but you can’t be both. Listen up! Every time, and I mean every
                                time, you blame, justify, or complain, you are slitting your
                                financial throat. Sure, it would be nice to use a kinder and gentler
                                metaphor, but forget it. I’m not interested in kind or gentle
                                right now. I’m interested in helping you see exactly what the
                                heck you’re doing to yourself ! Later, once you get rich, we can
                                be kinder and gentler, how’s that?</p>
                            <p>
                                It’s time to take back your power and acknowledge that you
                                create everything that is in your life and everything that is not
                                in it. Realize that you create your wealth, your non-wealth, and
                                every level in between.</p>

                            <p>Poor people play the money game on defense rather than offense. Let me ask you: If you
                                were to play any sport or any
                                game strictly on defense, what are the chances of your winning
                                that game? Most people would agree, slim and none.</p>
                            <p>
                                Yet that’s exactly how most people play the money game.
                                Their primary concern is survival and security instead of
                                creating wealth and abundance. So, what is your goal? What is
                                your objective? What is your true intention?</p>
                            <p>
                                The goal of truly rich people is to have massive wealth and
                                abundance. Not just some money, but lots of money. So what
                                is the big goal of poor people? To “have enough to pay
                                the bills... and on time would be a miracle!” Again, let me
                                remind you of the power of intention. When your intention is
                                to have enough to pay the bills, that’s exactly how much you’ll
                                get—just enough to pay the bills and not a dime more.</p>
                            <p>
                                Middle-class people at least go a step further... too bad it’s a
                                tiny step. Their big goal in life also happens to be their favorite
                                word in the whole wide world. They just want to be
                                “comfortable.” I hate to break the news to you, but there’s a
                                huge difference between being comfortable and being rich.</p>
                            <p>
                                I have to admit, I didn’t always know that. But one of the
                                reasons I believe I have the right to even write this book is
                                that I’ve had the experience of being on all three sides of the
                                proverbial fence. I’ve been extremely broke, as in having to
                                borrow a dollar for gas for my car. But let me qualify that.
                                First, it wasn’t my car. Second, that dollar came in the form of
                                four quarters. Do you know how embarrassing it is for an
                                adult to pay for gas with four quarters? The kid at the pump
                                looked at me as if I were some kind of vending-machine robber and then just shook his
                                head and laughed. I don’t know if
                                you can relate, but it was definitely one of my financial low
                                points and unfortunately just one of them.</p>
                            <p>
                                Once I got my act together, I graduated to the level of being
                                comfortable. Comfortable is nice. At least you go out to decent
                                restaurants for a change. But pretty much all I could order was
                                chicken. Now, there’s nothing wrong with chicken, if that’s
                                what you really want. But often it’s not.</p>
                            <p>
                                In fact, people who are only financially comfortable usually
                                decide on what to eat by looking at the right-hand side of the
                                menu—the price side. “What would you like for dinner
                                tonight, dear?” “I’ll have this $7.95 dish. Let’s see what it is.
                                Surprise, surprise, it’s the chicken,” for the nineteenth time
                                this week!</p>
                            <p>
                                When you’re comfortable, you don’t dare allow your eyes to
                                look at the bottom of the menu, for if you did, you might
                                come across the most forbidden words in the middle-class
                                dictionary: market price! And even if you were curious, you’d
                                never ask what the price actually is. First, because you know
                                you can’t afford it. Second, it’s downright embarrassing when
                                you know the waiter doesn’t believe you when he tells you the
                                dish is $49 with side dishes extra and you say, “You know
                                what, for some reason, I have a real craving for chicken
                                tonight!”</p>
                            <p>
                                I have to say that for me personally, one of the best things
                                about being rich is not having to look at the prices on the
                                menu anymore. I eat exactly what I want to eat regardless of
                                the price. I can assure you, I didn’t do that when I was broke or
                                comfortable.</p>
                            <p>
                                It boils down to this: If your goal is to be comfortable,
                                chances are you’ll never get rich. But if your goal is to be rich,
                                chances are you’ll end up mighty comfortable.</p>

                            <p>One of the principles we teach in our programs is “If you
                                shoot for the stars, you’ll at least hit the moon.” Poor people
                                don’t even shoot for the ceiling in their house, and then they
                                wonder why they’re not successful. Well, they just found out.
                                You get what you truly intend to get. If you want to get rich,
                                your goal has to be rich. Not to have enough to pay the bills,
                                and not just to have enough to be comfortable. Rich means
                                rich!</p>

                            <p>Ask most people if they want to be rich and they’d look at you
                                as if you were crazy. “Of course I want to be rich,” they’d say.
                                The truth, however, is that most people don’t really want to be
                                rich. Why? Because they have a lot of negative wealth
                                files in their subconscious mind that tell them there is something wrong with being
                                rich.</p>
                            <p>
                                At our Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar, one of the
                                questions we ask people is “What are some of the possible
                                negatives about being rich or trying to get rich?”</p>
                            <p>
                                Here’s what some people have to say. See if you can relate
                                to any of these.<br>
                                “What if I make it and lose it? Then I’ll really be a failure.”<br>
                                “I’ll never know if people like me for myself or for my
                                money.”<br>
                                “I’ll be at the highest tax bracket and have to give half my
                                money to the government.”<br>
                                “It’s too much work.”<br>
                                “I could lose my health trying.”<br>
                                “My friends and family will say, ‘Who do you think you
                                are?’ and criticize me.”<br>
                                “Everyone’s going to want a handout.”<br>
                                “I could be robbed.”<br>
                                “My kids could be kidnapped.”<br>
                                “It’s too much responsibility. I’ll have to manage all that
                                money. I’ll have to really understand investments. I’ll have to
                                worry about tax strategies and asset protection and have to
                                hire expensive accountants and lawyers. Yuck, what a hassle.”<br>
                                And on and on it goes....</p>
                            <p>
                                As I mentioned earlier, each of us has a wealth file inside
                                the cabinet called our mind. This file contains our personal
                                beliefs that include why being rich would be wonderful.
                                However, for many people, this file also includes information
                                as to why being rich might not be so wonderful. This means
                                they have mixed internal messages about wealth. One part of
                                them gleefully says, “Having more money will make
                                life a lot more fun.” But then another part screams, “Yeah, but
                                I’m going to have to work like a dog! What fun is that?” One
                                part says, “I’ll be able to travel the world.” Then the other part
                                chirps in, “Yeah, and everyone in the world will want a
                                handout.” These mixed messages may seem innocent enough,
                                but in reality, they are one of the major reasons most people
                                never become rich.</p>
                            <p>
                                You can look at it like this. The universe, which is another
                                way of saying “higher power,” is akin to a big mail-order department. It is constantly
                                delivering people, events, and things
                                to you. You “order” what you get by sending energetic
                                messages out to the universe based on your predominant beliefs. Again, based on the Law
                                of Attraction, the universe will
                                do its best to say yes and support you. But if you have mixed
                                messages in your file, the universe can’t understand what you
                                want.</p>
                            <p>
                                One minute the universe hears that you want to be rich, so
                                it begins sending you opportunities for wealth. But then it
                                hears you say, “Rich people are greedy,” so the universe begins
                                to support you in not having much money. But then you think,
                                “Having a lot of money makes life so much more enjoyable,”
                                so the poor universe, dazed and confused, restarts sending you
                                opportunities for more money. The next day you’re in an
                                uninspired mood so you think, “Money’s not that important.”
                                The frustrated universe finally screams, “Make up your frickin’
                                mind! I’ll get you what you want, just tell me what it is!”</p>
                            <p>
                                The number one reason most people don’t get what they want is that
                                they don’t know what they want. Rich people are totally clear that
                                they want wealth. They are unwavering in their desire. They
                                are fully committed to creating wealth. As long as it’s legal,
                                moral, and ethical, they will do whatever it takes
                                to have wealth. Rich people do not send mixed messages to
                                the universe. Poor people do.</p>
                            <p>
                                (By the way, when you read that last paragraph, if a little
                                voice inside your head said something to the effect of “Rich
                                people don’t care if it’s legal, moral, or ethical,” you are definitely doing the right
                                thing in reading this book. You’ll soon
                                find out what a detrimental way of thinking that is.)</p>

                                Poor people have plenty of good reasons as to why getting
                                and actually being rich might be a problem. Consequently, they
                                are not 100 percent certain they really want to be rich. Their
                                message to the universe is confusing. Their message to others
                                is confusing. And why does all of this confusion happen?
                                Because their message to themselves is confusing.</p>
                            <p>
                                Earlier we talked about the power of intention. I know it
                                might be hard to believe, but you always get what you want—
                                what you subconsciously want, not what you say you want. You
                                might emphatically deny this and respond, “That’s crazy! Why
                                would I want to struggle?” And my question for you is exactly
                                the same: “I don’t know. Why would you want to struggle?”
                                If you want to discover the reason, I invite you to attend the
                                Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar, where you will identify
                                your money blueprint. The answer will be staring you in the
                                face. Put bluntly, if you are not achieving the wealth you say
                                you desire, there’s a good chance it’s because,
                                first, you subconsciously don’t really want wealth, or second,
                                you’re not willing to do what it takes to create it.</p>
                            <p>
                                Let’s explore this further. There are actually three levels of
                                so-called wanting. The first level is “I want to be rich.” That’s
                                another way of saying, “I’ll take it if it falls in my lap.” Wanting
                                alone is useless. Have you noticed that wanting doesn’t
                                necessarily lead to “having”? Notice also that wanting without
                                having leads to more wanting. Wanting becomes habitual and
                                leads only to itself, creating a perfect circle that goes exactly
                                nowhere. Wealth does not come from merely wanting it. How
                                do you know this is true? With a simple reality check: billions
                                of people want to be rich, relatively few are.</p>
                            <p>
                                The second level of wanting is “I choose to be rich.” This
                                entails deciding to become rich. Choosing is a much stronger
                                energy and goes hand in hand with being responsible for
                                creating your reality. The word decision comes from the Latin
                                word decidere, which means “to kill off any other alternatives.”
                                Choosing is better but not best.</p>
                            <p>
                                The third level of wanting is “I commit to being rich.” The
                                definition of the word commit is “to devote oneself unreservedly.” This means holding
                                absolutely nothing back; giving
                                100 percent of everything you’ve got to achieving wealth. It
                                means being willing to do whatever it takes for as long as it
                                takes. This is the warrior’s way. No excuses, no ifs, no buts, no
                                maybes—and failure is not an option. The warrior’s way is
                                simple: “I will be rich or I will die trying.”</p>
                            <p>
                                “I commit to being rich.” Try saying that to yourself....
                                What comes up for you? For some, it feels empowering. For
                                others, it feels daunting.</p>
                            <p>
                                Most people would never truly commit to being rich. If you
                                asked them, “Would you bet your life that in the next
                                ten years you will be wealthy?” most would say, “No way!”
                                That’s the difference between rich people and poor people. It’s
                                precisely because people won’t truly commit to being rich that
                                they are not rich and most likely never will be.</p>
                            <p>
                                Some might say, “Harv, what are you talking about? I work
                                my butt off, I’m trying real hard. Of course I’m committed to
                                being rich.” And I would reply, “That you’re trying means
                                little. The definition of commitment is to devote oneself
                                unreservedly.” The key word is unreservedly. Which means
                                you’re putting everything, and I mean everything, you’ve got
                                into it. Most people I know who are not financially successful
                                have limits on how much they are willing to do, how much
                                they are willing to risk, and how much they are willing to
                                sacrifice. Although they think they’re willing to do whatever it
                                takes, upon deeper questioning I always find they have plenty
                                of conditions around what they are willing to do and not do to
                                succeed!</p>
                            <p>
                                I hate to have to be the one to tell you this, but getting rich
                                is not a stroll in the park, and anyone who tells you it is either
                                knows a heck of a lot more than me or is a little out of integrity. In my experience,
                                getting rich takes focus, courage,
                                knowledge, expertise, 100 percent of your effort, a never-giveup attitude, and of course
                                a rich mind-set. You also have to
                                believe in your heart of hearts that you can create wealth and
                                that you absolutely deserve it. Again, what this means is that, if
                                you are not fully, totally, and truly committed to creating
                                wealth, chances are you won’t.</p>

                                Are you willing to work sixteen hours a day? Rich people
                                are. Are you willing to work seven days a week and give up
                                most of your weekends? Rich people are. Are you willing to
                                sacrifice seeing your family, your friends, and give up your
                                recreations and hobbies? Rich people are. Are you willing to
                                risk all your time, energy, and start-up capital with no guarantee of returns? Rich
                                people are.</p>
                            <p>
                                For a time, hopefully a short time but often a long time, rich
                                people are ready and willing to do all of the above. Are you?
                                Maybe you’ll be lucky and you won’t have to work long or
                                hard or sacrifice anything. You can wish for that, but I sure
                                wouldn’t count on it. Again, rich people are committed
                                enough to do whatever it takes. Period.</p>
                            <p>
                                It’s interesting to note, however, that once you do commit,
                                the universe will bend over backward to support you. One of
                                my favorite passages is by explorer W. H. Murray, who wrote
                                the following during one of the first Himalayan expeditions:</p>

                                        commitment for the purpose of creating greater success. Put
                                        your hand on your heart, look that person in the eye, and
                                        repeat the following statement:</p>
                                    <p>“I, ____________ [your name], do hereby commit to
                                        becoming a millionaire or more by ________ [date].”
                                        Tell your partner to say, “I believe in you.” Then you say,
                                        “Thank you.”</p>
                                    <p>P.S. Check in as to how you feel before your com -

                                        freedom, you’re on your way. If you feel a tinge of fear,
                                        you’re on your way. If you didn’t bother doing it, you’re

                            <p>We once had a trainer teaching at one of our seminars who
                                went from a net worth of $250,000 to over $600 million in
                                only three years. When asked his secret, he said, “Everything
                                changed the moment I began to think big.” I refer you to the
                                Law of Income, which states, “You will be paid in direct proportion to the value you
                                deliver according to the marketplace.”</p>

                                    <h4 class="card-title">The Law of Income: You will be paid in
                                        direct proportion to the value you deliver
                                        according to the marketplace.</h4>

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                The key word is value. It’s important to know that four
                                factors determine your value in the marketplace: supply, demand,
                                quality, and quantity. In my experience, the factor that presents
                                the biggest challenge for most people is the quantity. The
                                quantity factor simply means, how much of your value do you
                                actually deliver to the marketplace?</p>
                            <p>
                                Another way of stating this is, how many people do you
                                actually serve or affect?</p>
                            <p>
                                In my business, for instance, some trainers prefer teaching
                                small groups of twenty people at a time, others are comfortable with a hundred
                                participants in the room, others like an
                                audience of five hundred, and still others love audiences of a
                                thousand to five thousand or more. Is there a difference in
                                income among these trainers? You better believe there is!</p>
                            <p>
                                Consider the network marketing business. Is there a difference in income between someone
                                who has ten people in his
                                or her down-line and someone who has ten thousand people?
                                I would think so!</p>
                            <p>
                                Near the beginning of this book, I mentioned that I owned
                                a chain of retail fitness stores. From the moment I even
                                considered going into this business, my intention was to have
                                one hundred successful stores and affect tens of thousands of
                                people. My competitor, on the other hand, who started six
                                months after me, had the intention of owning one successful
                                store. In the end, she earned a decent living. I got rich!</p>
                            <p>
                                How do you want to live your life? How do you want to
                                play the game? Do you want to play in the big leagues or in the
                                little leagues, in the majors or the minors? Are you going to
                                play big or play small? It’s your choice.</p>
                            <p>
                                Most people choose to play small. Why? First, because of
                                fear. They’re scared to death of failure and they’re even more
                                frightened of success. Second, people play small because they
                                feel small. They feel unworthy. They don’t feel they’re good
                                enough or important enough to make a real difference in
                                people’s lives.</p>
                            <p>
                                But hear this: Your life is not just about you. It’s also about
                                contributing to others. It’s about living true to your mission
                                and reason for being here on this earth at this time. It’s about
                                adding your piece of the puzzle to the world. Most people are
                                so stuck in their egos that everything revolves around me, me,
                                and more me. But if you want to be rich in the truest sense of
                                the word, it can’t only be about you. It has to include adding
                                value to other people’s lives.</p>
                            <p>
                                One of the greatest inventors and philosophers of our time,
                                Buckminster Fuller, said, “The purpose of our lives is to add
                                value to the people of this generation and those that follow.”</p>
                            <p>
                                We each came to this earth with natural talents, things we’re
                                just naturally good at. These gifts were given to you for a
                                reason: to use and share with others. Research shows that the
                                happiest people are those who use their natural talents to the
                                utmost. Part of your mission in life then must be to share your
                                gifts and value with as many people as possible. That means
                                being willing to play big.</p>
                            <p>
                                Do you know the definition of an entrepreneur? The definition we use in our programs is
                                “a person who solves problems for people at a profit.” That’s right, an entrepreneur is
                                nothing more than a “problem solver.”</p>
                            <p>
                                So I ask you, would you rather solve problems for more
                                people or fewer people? If you replied more, then you need to
                                start thinking bigger and decide to help massive numbers of
                                people—thousands, even millions. The by-product is that the
                                more people you help, the “richer” you become, mentally,
                                emotionally, spiritually, and definitely financially.</p>
                            <p>
                                Make no mistake, every person on this planet has a mission.
                                If you are living right now, there’s a reason for it. Richard
                                Bach, in his book Jonathan Livingston Seagull, is asked, “How will
                                I know when I’ve completed my mission?” The answer? “If
                                you are still breathing, you are not done.”</p>
                            <p>
                                What I have witnessed is too many people not doing their
                                job, not fulfilling their duty, or dharma as it’s called in Sanskrit. I
                                watch too many people playing far too small, and too many
                                people allowing their fear-based ego selves to rule them. The
                                result is that too many of us are not living up to
                                our full potential, in terms of both our own lives and our
                                contribution to others.</p>
                            <p>
                                It comes down to this: If not you, then who?<br>
                                Again, everyone has his or her unique purpose. Maybe
                                you’re a real estate investor and buy properties to rent them
                                out and make money on cash flow and appreciation. What’s
                                your mission? How do you help? There’s a good chance you
                                add value to your community by helping families find affordable housing they may not
                                otherwise be able to find. Now
                                the question is how many families and people can you assist?
                                Are you willing to help ten instead of one, twenty instead of
                                ten, one hundred instead of twenty? This is what I mean by
                                playing big.</p>

                                                permission to do the same. As we are

                                The world doesn’t need more people playing small. It’s time
                                to stop hiding out and start stepping out. It’s time to stop
                                needing and start leading. It’s time to start sharing your gifts
                                instead of hoarding them or pretending they don’t exist. It’s
                                time you started playing the game of life in a “big” way.</p>

                                In the end, small thinking and small actions lead to being
                                both broke and unfulfilled. Big thinking and big actions
                                lead to having both money and meaning. The choice is yours!</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">If someone had said to me I would have doubled my
                                        income and simultaneously doubled my time off, I would
                                        have said that was not possible. But that is exactly what has
                                        happened.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In one year our business grew 175 percent, and in that
                                        same year we took a total of seven weeks of vacation time
                                        (much of that spent at additional Peak Potentials’ seminars)!
                                        This is astounding considering we had experienced minimal
                                        growth over the previous five years and struggled to get
                                        even two weeks of time off a year.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        As a result of knowing Harv Eker and being involved with
                                        Peak Potentials, I have a deeper understanding of myself
                                        and a greater appreciation for the abundance in my life. My
                                        relationship with my wife and children has been
                                        immeasurably enhanced. I now see more opportunities than
                                        I ever thought possible. I feel that I truly am on the right path
                                        to success in all its facets.</p>

                            <p>Rich people see opportunities. Poor people see obstacles. Rich
                                people see potential growth. Poor people see potential loss.
                                Rich people focus on the rewards. Poor focus on the risks.
                                It comes down to the age-old question, “Is the glass half
                                empty or half full?” We’re not talking positive thinking here,
                                we’re talking about your habitual perspective on the world.
                                Poor people make choices based upon fear. Their minds are
                                constantly scanning for what is wrong or could go wrong in
                                any situation. Their primary mind-set is “What if it doesn’t
                                work?” or, more often, “It won’t work.”
                                Middle-class people are slightly more optimistic. Their
                                mind-set is “I sure hope this works.”
                                The Wealth Files - 79
                                Rich people, as we’ve said earlier, take responsibility for the
                                results in their lives and act upon the mind-set “It will work
                                because I’ll make it work.”
                                Rich people expect to succeed. They have confidence in
                                their abilities, they have confidence in their creativity, and they
                                believe that should the doo-doo hit the fan, they can find
                                another way to succeed.
                                Generally speaking, the higher the reward, the higher the
                                risk. Because they constantly see opportunity, rich people are
                                willing to take a risk. Rich people believe that, if worse comes
                                to worst, they can always make their money back.
                                Poor people, on the other hand, expect to fail. They lack
                                confidence in themselves and in their abilities. Poor people
                                believe that should things not work out, it would be catastrophic. And because they
                                constantly see obstacles, they are
                                usually unwilling to take a risk. No risk, no reward.
                                For the record, being willing to risk doesn’t necessarily
                                mean that you are willing to lose. Rich people take educated
                                risks. This means that they research, do their due diligence,
                                and make decisions based on solid information and facts. Do
                                rich people take forever to get educated? No. They do what
                                they can in as short a time as possible, then make an informed
                                decision to go for it or not.
                                Although poor people claim to be preparing for an
                                opportunity, what they’re usually doing is stalling. They’re
                                scared to death, hemming and hawing for weeks, months, and
                                even years on end, and by then the opportunity usually
                                disappears. Then they rationalize the situation by saying, “I
                                was getting ready.” Sure enough, but while they were “getting
                                ready,” the rich guy got in, got out, and made another fortune.

                                I know what I’m about to say may sound a little strange
                                considering how much I value self-responsibility. However, I
                                do believe a certain element of what many people call luck is
                                associated with getting rich, or, for that matter, with being
                                successful at anything.
                                In football, it might be the opposing team’s player fumbling
                                on your own one-yard line with less than a minute to go,
                                allowing your team to win the game. In golf it could be the
                                errant shot that hits an out-of-bounds tree and bounces back
                                onto the green, just three inches from the hole.
                                In business, how many times have you heard of a guy who
                                plops some money down on a piece of land in the boonies,
                                and ten years later, some conglomerate decides it wants to
                                build a shopping center or office building on it? This investor
                                gets rich. So, was it a brilliant business move on his part or
                                sheer luck? My guess is that it’s a bit of both.
                                The point, however, is that no luck—or anything else
                                worthwhile—will come your way unless you take some form
                                of action. To succeed financially, you have to do something,
                                buy something, or start something. And when you do, is it luck
                                or is it the universe or a higher power supporting you in its
                                miraculous ways for having the courage and commitment to
                                go for it? As far as I’m concerned, who cares what it is. It
                                happens!
                                Another key principle, pertinent here, is that rich people
                                focus on what they want, while poor people focus on what
                                they don’t want. Again, the universal law states, “What you
                                focus on expands.” Because rich people focus on the opportunities in everything,
                                opportunities abound for them. Their
                                biggest problem is handling all the incredible moneymaking
                                possibilities they see. On the other hand, because

                                poor people focus on the obstacles in everything, obstacles
                                abound for them and their biggest problem is handling all the
                                incredible obstacles they see.
                                It’s simple. Your field of focus determines what you find in
                                life. Focus on opportunities and that’s what you find. Focus on
                                obstacles and that’s what you find. I’m not saying that you
                                don’t take care of problems. Of course, handle problems as
                                they arise, in the present. But keep your eye on your goal, keep
                                moving toward your target. Put your time and energy into
                                creating what you want. When obstacles arise, handle them,
                                then quickly refocus on your vision. You do not make your life
                                about solving problems. You don’t spend all your time fighting
                                fires. Those who do, move backward! You spend your time
                                and energy in thought and deed, moving steadily forward,
                                toward your goal.
                                Do you want some simple but extremely rare advice? Here
                                it is: If you want to get rich, focus on making, keeping, and
                                investing your money. If you want to be poor, focus on
                                spending your money. You can read a thousand books and
                                take a hundred courses on success, but it all boils down to
                                that. Remember, what you focus on expands.
                                Rich people also understand that you can never know all the
                                information beforehand. In another of our programs,
                                Enlightened Warrior Training, we train people to access their
                                inner power and succeed in spite of anything. In this course
                                we teach a principle known as “Ready, fire, aim!” What do we
                                mean? Get ready the best you can in as short a time as
                                possible; take action; then correct along the way.
                                It’s nuts to think you can know everything that may happen
                                in the future. It’s delusional to believe you can prepare for
                                every circumstance that might someday occur and pro-

                                tect yourself from it. Did you know that there are no straight
                                lines in the universe? Life doesn’t travel in perfectly straight
                                lines. It moves more like a winding river. More often than not,
                                you can only see to the next bend, and only when you reach
                                that next turn can you see more.
                                The idea is to get in the game with whatever you’ve got,
                                from wherever you are. I call this entering the corridor. For
                                example, years ago I was planning on opening an all-night
                                dessert café in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I studied location
                                options, the marketplace, and found out what equipment I’d
                                need. I also researched the kinds of cakes, pies, ice creams, and
                                coffees available. The first big problem—I got really fat!
                                Eating my research wasn’t helpful. So I asked myself, “Harv,
                                what would be the best way to study this business?” Then I
                                heard this guy named Harv, who was obviously a lot smarter
                                than me, answer, “If you really want to learn a business, get
                                into it. You don’t have to own the darn thing from day one.
                                Get in the corridor by getting a job in the arena. You’ll learn
                                more by sweeping up a restaurant and washing dishes than by
                                ten years of research from the outside.” (I told you he was a
                                lot smarter than me.)
                                And that’s what I did. I got a job at Mother Butler’s Pie
                                Shop. I wish I could tell you that they immediately recognized
                                my superb talents and started me as CEO. But alas, somehow
                                they just didn’t see, nor did they care about, my executive
                                leadership skills, and so I began as a busboy. That’s right,
                                sweeping the floor and clearing dishes. Funny how the power
                                of intention works, isn’t it?
                                You might think that I must really have had to swallow my
                                pride to do this, but the truth is, I never looked at it that way. I
                                was on a mission to learn the dessert business; I was
                                The Wealth Files . 83
                                grateful for the opportunity to learn it on someone else’s
                                “ticket” and make some pocket change to boot.
                                During my tenure as the pie busboy, I spent as much time
                                as possible shootin’ the doo-doo with the manager about revenues and profits, checking
                                boxes to find out the names of the
                                suppliers, and helping the baker at 4:00 a.m., to learn about
                                equipment, ingredients, and problems that could occur.
                                A full week went by and I guess I was pretty good at my
                                job, because the manager sat me down, fed me some pie
                                (yuck!), and promoted me to...(drumroll please) cashier ! I
                                thought about it long and hard, for exactly a nanosecond, and
                                replied, “Thanks but no thanks.”
                                First, there was no way I could learn much being stuck
                                behind a cash register. Second, I’d already learned what I came
                                to learn. Mission accomplished!
                                So that’s what I mean by being in the “corridor.” It means
                                entering the arena where you want to be in the future, in any
                                capacity, to get started. This is far and away the best way to
                                learn about a business, because you see it from the inside.
                                Second, you can make the contacts you need, which you could
                                never have made from the outside. Third, once you’re in the
                                corridor, many other doors of opportunity may open to you.
                                That is, once you witness what’s really going on, you may
                                discover a niche for yourself that you hadn’t recognized
                                before. Fourth, you may find that you don’t really like this
                                field, and thank goodness you found out before you got in too
                                deep!
                                So which of the above happened for me? By the time I was
                                done with Mother Butler’s, I couldn’t stand the smell or sight
                                of pie. Second, the baker quit the day after I left, phoned me,
                                and explained that he had just found out about a hot, new
                                84 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                piece of exercise equipment known as Gravity Guidance inversion boots (you may have seen
                                Richard Gere hang upside
                                down in these in the movie American Gigolo) and wanted to
                                know if I was interested in looking at them. I checked things
                                out and decided the boots were dynamite, but he wasn’t, so I
                                got involved on my own.
                                I began selling the boots to sporting-goods and department
                                stores. I noticed these retail outlets all had one thing in
                                common—crummy exercise equipment. My brain bells went
                                berserk—“Opportunity, opportunity, opportunity.” Funny
                                how things happen. This was my first experience selling
                                exercise equipment, which eventually led me to opening one of
                                the first retail fitness stores in North America and making my
                                very first million. And to think it all started with me being a
                                busboy at Mother Butler’s Pies Shop! The moral is simple: get
                                in the corridor. You never know what doors will open unto
                                you.
                                I have a motto: “Action always beats inaction.” Rich people
                                get started. They trust that once they get in the game, they can
                                make intelligent decisions in the present moment, make
                                corrections, and adjust their sails along the way.
                                Poor people don’t trust in themselves or their abilities, so
                                they believe they have to know everything in advance, which is
                                virtually impossible. Meanwhile they don’t do squat! In the
                                end, with their positive, “ready, fire, aim,” attitude, rich people
                                take action and usually win.
                                In the end, by telling themselves, “I’m not doing anything
                                until I’ve identified every possible problem and know exactly
                                what to do about it,” poor people never take action and
                                therefore always lose.
                                Rich people see an opportunity, jump on it, and get even
                                richer. As for poor people? They’re still “preparing”!

                                1. Get in the game. Consider a situation or project you’ve
                                wanted to start. Whatever you’ve been waiting for, forget it.
                                Begin now from wherever you are with whatever you’ve
                                got. If possible, do it while working for or with someone
                                else, first, to learn the ropes. If you’ve already learned, no
                                more excuses. Go for it!
                                2. Practice optimism. Today, whatever anyone says is a
                                problem or an obstacle, reframe it into an opportunity.
                                You’ll drive negative people nuts, but, hey, what’s the
                                difference? That’s what they’re constantly doing to
                                themselves anyway!
                                3. Focus on what you have, not on what you don’t have. Make
                                a list of ten things you are grateful for in your life and read
                                the list aloud. Then read it each morning for the next thirty
                                days. If you don’t appreciate what you’ve got, you won’t get
                                any more and you don’t need any more. </p>

                            <p>Poor people often look at other people’s success with resentment, jealousy, and envy. Or
                                they snip, “They’re so lucky,” or
                                whisper under their breath, “Those rich jerks.”
                                You have to realize that if you view rich people as bad in any
                                way, shape, or form, and you want to be a good person, then
                                you can never be rich. It’s impossible. How can you be
                                something you despise?
                                It’s amazing to witness the resentment and even outright
                                anger that many poor people have toward the rich. As if they
                                believe that rich people make them poor. “Yup, that’s right,
                                rich people took all the money so there’s none left for me.” Of
                                course, this is perfect victim talk.
                                I want to tell you a story, not to complain, but simply to relate a real-world
                                experience I had with this principle. In the old
                                days, when I was, let’s say, financially challenged, I used to
                                drive a clunker. Changing lanes in traffic was never a problem.
                                Almost everybody would let me in. But when I got rich and
                                bought a gorgeous, new, black Jaguar, I couldn’t help but
                                notice how things changed. All of a sudden I started getting
                                cut off and sometimes given the finger for added measure. I
                                even got things thrown at me, all for one reason: I drove a Jag.
                                One day, I was driving through a lower-end neighborhood
                                in San Diego, delivering turkeys for a charity at Christmastime.
                                I had the sunroof open and I noticed four grimy guys perched
                                in the back of a pickup truck behind me. Out of nowhere, they
                                started playing basketball with
                                The Wealth Files - 87
                                my car, by attempting to shoot beer cans into my open sunroof. Five dents and several
                                deep scratches later, they passed
                                me screaming, “You rich bastard!”
                                Of course, I figured this to be an isolated incident, until just
                                two weeks later, in a different lower-end neighborhood, I
                                parked my car on the street and returned to it less than ten
                                minutes later, to discover that the entire side of my car had
                                been keyed.
                                The next time I went to that area of town, I rented a Ford
                                Escort, and amazingly, I didn’t have a single problem. I’m not
                                implying that poorer neighborhoods have bad people, but in
                                my experience, they sure seem to have plenty of folks who
                                resent the rich. Who knows, maybe it’s some kind of chickenand-egg thing: Is it because
                                they’re broke that they resent the
                                rich, or because they resent rich people that they’re broke. As
                                far as I’m concerned, who cares? It’s all the same, they’re still
                                poor!
                                It’s easy to talk about not resenting the rich, but depending
                                on your mood, falling into the trap can happen to anyone,
                                even me. Recently, I was eating dinner in my hotel room,
                                about an hour before going onstage to teach an evening
                                session of the Millionaire Mind seminar. I turned on the tube
                                to check the sports scores and found that Oprah was on.
                                Although I’m not a big fan of television, I love Oprah. That
                                woman has affected more people in a positive way than almost
                                anyone else on the planet, and consequently she deserves every
                                penny she’s got... and more!
                                Meanwhile, she’s interviewing actress Halle Berry. They’re
                                discussing how Halle has just received one of the largest film
                                contracts in history for a female actor—$20 million. Halle then
                                says that she doesn’t care about the money, and that she
                                fought for this humongous contract to blaze a trail for other

                                women to follow. I heard myself say skeptically, “Yeah, right!
                                Do you think I and everyone else watching this show is an
                                idiot? You should take a hunk of that dough and give your
                                public relations agent a raise. That’s the best sound-bite
                                writing I’ve ever heard.”
                                I felt the negativity welling up inside me, and just in the nick
                                of time I caught myself, before the energy took me over.
                                “Cancel, cancel, thank you for sharing,” I yelled out loud to
                                my mind, to drown out that voice of resentment.
                                I couldn’t believe it. Here I was, Mr. Millionaire Mind
                                himself, actually resenting Halle Berry for the money she
                                made. I quickly turned it around and began screaming at the
                                top of my lungs, “Way to go, girl! You rock! You let ’em off
                                too cheap, you should’ve got thirty million dollars! Good for
                                you. You’re incredible and you deserve it.” I felt a lot better.
                                Regardless of her reason for wanting all that money, the
                                problem wasn’t her, it was me. Remember, my opinions make
                                no difference to Halle’s happiness or wealth, but they do make
                                a difference to my happiness and wealth. Also remember that
                                thoughts and opinions aren’t good or bad, right or wrong, as
                                they enter your mind, but they can sure be empowering or
                                disempowering to your happiness and success, as they enter
                                your life.
                                The moment I felt that negative energy run through me, my
                                “observation” alarms went off, and as I’ve trained myself to
                                do, I immediately neutralized the negativity in my mind. You
                                don’t have to be perfect to get rich, but you do need to
                                recognize when your thinking isn’t empowering to yourself or
                                others, then quickly refocus on more supportive thoughts. The

                                course, but please understand, I wouldn’t be so adamant about
                                this program if I didn’t see for myself the phenomenal results
                                people get in their lives.
                                In their outstanding book The One Minute Millionaire, my
                                good friends Mark Victor Hansen and Robert Allen quote the
                                poignant story of Russell H. Conwell in his book, Acres of
                                Diamonds, which was written over a hundred years ago:
                                I say that you ought to get rich, and it is your duty to get rich.
                                How many of my pious brethren say to me, “Do you, a Chris
                                tian minister, spend your time going up and down the country
                                advising young people to get rich, to get money?” Yes, of course
                                I do.
                                They say, “Isn’t that awful! Why don’t you preach the gospel
                                instead of preaching about man’s making money?” Because to make
                                money honestly is to preach the gospel. That is the reason. The men
                                who get rich may be the most honest men you find in the community.
                                “Oh,” but says some young man here tonight, “I have been told all
                                my life that if a person has money he is very dishonest and dishonorable
                                and mean and contemptible.” My friend, that is the reason you have
                                none, because you have that idea of people. The foundation of your
                                faith is altogether false. Let me say clearly... ninety-eight out of one
                                hundred of the rich men (and women) of America are honest. That is
                                why they are rich. That is why they are trusted with money. That is
                                why they carry on great enterprises and find plenty of people to work
                                with them.
                                Says another young man, “I hear sometimes of men that get
                                millions of dollars dishonestly.” Yes, of course you do, and so do

                                them all the time as a matter of news until you get the idea that all
                                the other rich men got rich dishonestly.

                                their homes are made more honorable and honest and pure, and true
                                and economical and careful, by owning them.
                                We preach against covetousness...in the pulpit...and use the
                                terms...“filthy lucre” so extremely that Christians get the idea that...it
                                is wicked for any man to have money. Money is power, and you ought
                                to be reasonably ambitious to have it! You ought because you can do
                                more good with it than you can without it. Money printed your Bibles,
                                money builds your churches, money sends your missionaries, and money
                                pays your preachers....I say, then, you ought to have money. If you can
                                honestly attain unto riches...it is your... godly duty to do so. It is an
                                awful mistake of these pious people to think you must be awfully poor
                                in order to be pious.
                                Conwell’s passage makes several excellent points. The first
                                refers to the ability to be trusted. Of all the attributes necessary
                                for getting rich, having others trust you has to be near the top
                                of the list. Think about it, would you do business with a
                                person you didn’t trust at least to some extent? No way!
                                Meaning that to get rich, there’s a good chance many, many,
                                many people must trust you, and there’s a good chance that
                                for that many people to trust you, you have to be quite
                                trustworthy.

                                What other traits does a person need to get rich and, even
                                more importantly, stay rich? No doubt there are always
                                exceptions to any rule, but for the most part, who do you have
                                to be to succeed at anything? Try some of these characteristics
                                on for size: positive, reliable, focused, determined, persistent,
                                hardworking, energetic, good with people, a competent
                                communicator, semi-intelligent, and an expert in at least one
                                area.
                                Another interesting element in Conwell’s passage is that so
                                many people have been conditioned to believe that you can’t
                                be rich and a good person or rich and spiritual. I too used to
                                think this way. Like many of us, I was told by friends, teachers,
                                media, and the rest of society that rich people were somehow
                                bad, that they were all greedy. Once again, another way of
                                thinking that ended up being pure crapola! Backed by my own
                                real-world experience, rather than old, fear-based myth, I have
                                found that the richest people I know are also the nicest.
                                When I moved to San Diego, we moved into a home in one
                                of the richest parts of town. We loved the beauty of the home
                                and the area, but I had some trepidation because I didn’t know
                                anyone and felt I didn’t yet fit in. My plan was to stay low-key
                                and not mix much with these rich snobs. As the universe
                                would have it, however, my kids, who were five and seven
                                years old at the time, made friends with the other kids in the
                                neighborhood, and pretty soon I was driving them to these
                                mansions to drop them off to play. I remember knocking on a
                                stunningly carved wooden door that was at least twenty feet
                                high. The mom opened it up and, with the friendliest voice I’d
                                ever heard, said, “Harv, it’s so great to meet you, come on in.”
                                I was a bit bewildered as she poured me some iced tea and got
                                me a bowl of fruit. “What’s the
                                92 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                catch?” my skeptical mind kept wanting to know. Then her
                                husband came in from playing with his kids in the pool. He
                                was even friendlier: “Harv, we’re so happy to have you in the
                                neighborhood. You have to come to our BBQ tonight with
                                the rest of your family. We’ll introduce you to everybody, and
                                we’re not taking no for an answer. By the way, do you golf ?
                                I’m playing tomorrow at the club, why don’t you come as my
                                guest.” By now I was in shock. What happened to the snobs I
                                was sure I was going to meet? I left and went back home to
                                tell my wife we were going to the BBQ.
                                “Oh, my,” she said, “what will I wear?” “No, honey, you
                                don’t understand,” I said, “these people are incredibly nice and
                                totally informal. Just be who you are.”
                                We went and that evening met some of the warmest,
                                kindest, most generous, most loving people of our lives. At
                                one point the conversation shifted to a charity drive that one
                                of the guests was heading up. One after another, the checkbooks came out. I couldn’t
                                believe it, I was actually watching a
                                lineup to give this woman money. But each check came with a
                                catch. The agreement was that there would be reciprocity and
                                that the woman would support the charity the donor was
                                involved in. That’s right, to a T, every person there either
                                headed up or was a major player in a charity.
                                Our friends who had invited us were involved in several. In
                                fact, each year they made it their goal to be the single largest
                                donor in the entire city to the Children’s Hospital Fund. They
                                not only gave tens of thousands of dollars themselves, but
                                every year they organized a dinner gala that raised hundreds of
                                thousands more.
                                Then there was the “vein” doctor. We became quite close
                                with his family too. He was among the top varicose vein
                                doctors in the world and made a fortune; somewhere in the
                                The Wealth Files - 93
                                range of $5,000 to $10,000 per surgery, doing four or five
                                surgeries per day.
                                I bring him up because every Tuesday was “free” day, when
                                he would do surgeries on people in the city who couldn’t
                                afford to pay. On this day, he would work from
                                6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. doing as many as ten surgeries, all for
                                free. On top of this, he headed up his own organization whose
                                mission was to get other doctors to do free days for people in
                                their communities too.
                                Needless to say, my old, conditioned belief that rich people
                                were greedy snobs dissipated in the light of reality. Now I
                                know the opposite to be true. In my experience, the richest
                                people I know are the nicest people I know. They are also the
                                most generous. Not to say that people who aren’t rich aren’t
                                nice or generous. But I can safely say the idea that all rich
                                people are somehow bad is nothing more than ignorance.
                                The fact is, resenting the rich is one of the surest ways to
                                stay broke. We are creatures of habit, and to overcome this or
                                any other habit, we need to practice. Instead of resenting rich
                                people, I want you to practice admiring rich people, I want you
                                to practice blessing rich people, and I want you to practice loving
                                rich people. That way, unconsciously you know that when you
                                become rich, other people will admire you, bless you, and love
                                you instead of resent the heck out of you the way you might
                                do them now.
                                One of the philosophies I live by comes from ancient Huna
                                wisdom, the original teachings of the Hawaiian elders. It goes
                                like this: bless that which you want. If you see a person with a
                                beautiful home, bless that person and bless that home. If you
                                see a person with a beautiful car, bless that person and bless
                                that car. If you see a person with a loving family, bless that
                                person and bless that family. If you see a
                                94 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                person with a beautiful body, bless that person and bless their
                                body.

                                The point is, if you resent what people have, in any way, shape,
                                or form, you can never have it. Regardless: if you see a person
                                in a gorgeous black Jaguar with the sunroof open, don’t throw
                                beer cans at it!
                                DECLARATIONS: Place your hand on your heart and say...

                                “I bless rich people!”

                                1. Practice the Huna philosophy “bless that which you want.”
                                Drive around or buy magazines, look at beautiful homes,
                                gorgeous cars, and read about successful businesses.
                                Whatever you see that you like, bless it, and bless the
                                owners or the people involved.
                                2. Write and send a short letter or e-mail to someone you
                                know of (not necessarily personally) who is highly successful
                                in any arena, telling them how much you admire and honor
                                them for their achievements.</p>

                            <p>Successful people look at other successful people as a means
                                to motivate themselves. They see other successful people as
                                models to learn from. They say to themselves, “If they can do
                                it, I can do it.” As I mentioned earlier, modeling is one of the
                                primary ways that people learn.
                                Rich people are grateful that others have succeeded before
                                them so that they now have a blueprint to follow that will
                                make it easier to attain their own success. Why reinvent the
                                wheel? There are proven methods for success that work for
                                virtually everyone who applies them.
                                Consequently, the fastest and easiest way to create wealth is
                                to learn exactly how rich people, who are masters of money,
                                play the game. The goal is to simply model their inner and
                                outer strategies. It just makes sense: if you take the exact same
                                actions and have the exact same mind-set, chances are good
                                you will get the exact same results. That’s what I did and that’s
                                what this entire book is about.
                                Contrary to the rich, when poor people hear about other
                                people’s success, they often judge them, criticize them, mock
                                them, and try to pull them down to their own level. How many
                                of you know people like this? How many of you know family
                                members like this? The question is, how can you possibly learn
                                from or be inspired by someone you put down?
                                Whenever I’m introduced to an extremely rich person, I
                                create a way to get together with them. I want to talk to them,
                                learn how they think, exchange contacts, and if we
                                96 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                have other things in common, possibly become personal
                                friends with them.
                                By the way, if you think I’m wrong for preferring to be
                                friends with rich people, perhaps you’d rather I pick friends
                                who are broke? I don’t think so! As I’ve mentioned before,
                                energy is contagious, and I have no interest in subjecting
                                myself to theirs!
                                I was recently doing a radio interview and a woman called in
                                with an excellent question: “What do I do if I’m positive and
                                want to grow, but my husband is a downer? Do I leave him?
                                Do I try and get him to change? What?” I hear this question at
                                least a hundred times a week when I’m teaching our courses.
                                Almost everyone asks the same question: “What if the people
                                I’m closest to aren’t into personal growth and even put me
                                down for it?”
                                Here’s the answer I gave the woman on the call, what I tell
                                people at our courses, and what I’m suggesting to you.
                                First, don’t bother trying to get negative people to change
                                or come to the course. That’s not your job. Your job is to use
                                what you’ve learned to better yourself and your life. Be the
                                model, be successful, be happy, then maybe—and I stress
                                maybe—they’ll see the light (in you) and want some of it. Again,
                                energy is contagious. Darkness dissipates in light. People
                                actually have to work hard to stay “dark” when light is all
                                around them. Your job is simply to be the best you can be. If
                                they choose to ask you your secret, tell them.
                                Second, keep in mind another principle that we feature in
                                our Wizard Training, which is a course about manifesting what
                                you want while staying calm, centered, and peaceful. It states,
                                “Everything happens for a reason and that reason is there to
                                assist me.” Yes, it’s much more difficult to be posi-
                                The Wealth Files - 97
                                tive and conscious around people and circumstances that are
                                negative, but that’s your test! Just as steel is hardened in the
                                fire, if you can remain true to your values while others around
                                you are full of doubt and even condemnation, you’ll grow
                                faster and stronger.
                                Also remember that “nothing has meaning except for the
                                meaning we give it.” Recall in Part I of this book, we discussed
                                how we usually end up identifying with or rebelling against one
                                or both of our parents, depending on how we “framed” their
                                actions. From now on, I want you to practice reframing other
                                people’s negativity as a reminder of how not to be. The more
                                negative they are, the more reminders you have about how ugly
                                that way of being really is. I’m not suggesting you tell them
                                this. Just do it, without condemning them for how they are.
                                For if you do begin to judge, criticize, and put them down for
                                who they are and what they do, then you are no better than
                                them.
                                Worse comes to worst, if you just can’t handle their nonsupportive energy anymore, if
                                it’s bringing you down to a
                                point where you’re not able to grow, you may have to make
                                some courageous decisions about who you are and how you
                                want to live the rest of your life. I’m not suggesting you do
                                anything rash, but I for one would never live with a person
                                who was negative and pooh-poohed my desire to learn and
                                grow, be it personally, spiritually, or financially. I wouldn’t do
                                that to myself because I respect myself and my life and I
                                deserve to be as happy and successful as possible. The way I
                                figure it, there are over 6.3 billion people in the world and
                                there’s no way I’m going to saddle myself with a downer. Either they move up or I move
                                on!
                                Again, energy is contagious: either you affect people or
                                98 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                infect people. The same holds true the opposite way around;
                                either people affect or infect you. Let me ask you a question:
                                Would you hug and hold a person you knew had a severe case
                                of the measles? Most people would say, “No way, I don’t want
                                to catch the measles.” Well, I believe negative thinking is like
                                having measles of the mind. Instead of itching, you get bitching;
                                instead of scratching, you get bashing; instead of irritation, you
                                get frustration. Now, do you really want to be close to people
                                like that?
                                I’m sure you’ve heard the saying “Birds of a feather flock
                                together.” Did you know that most people earn within 20
                                percent of the average income of their closest friends? That’s
                                why you’d better watch whom you associate with and choose
                                whom you spend your time with carefully.
                                From my experience, rich people don’t just join the country
                                club to play golf; they join to connect with other rich and
                                successful people. There’s another saying that goes “It’s not
                                what you know, it’s who you know.” As far as I’m concerned,
                                you can take that to the bank. In short, “If you want to fly
                                with the eagles, don’t swim with the ducks!” I make it a point
                                to only associate with successful, positive people, and just as
                                importantly, I disassociate from negative ones.
                                I also make it a point to remove myself from toxic situations. I see no reason for
                                infecting myself with poisonous energy. Among these I would include arguing, gossiping,
                                and
                                backstabbing. I would also include watching “mindless”
                                television, unless you use it specifically as a relaxation strategy
                                instead of your sole form of entertainment. When I watch TV,
                                it’s usually sports. First, because I enjoy seeing masters at
                                anything at work or in this case play, and second because I
                                enjoy listening to the interviews after the games. I
                                The Wealth Files - 99
                                love listening to the mind-set of champions, and to me, anyone who has made it as far as
                                the big leagues in any sport is a
                                champion. Any athlete at that level has outcompeted tens of
                                thousands of other players to get there at all, which makes
                                each of them incredible to me. I love hearing their attitude
                                when they win: “It was a great effort from the entire team. We
                                did well but we still have improvements to make. It goes to
                                show you that hard work pays off.” I also love listening to
                                their attitude when they lose: “It’s only one game. We’ll be
                                back, we’re just going to forget about this one and put our
                                focus on the next game. We’ll go back and talk about where
                                we can do better, and then do whatever it takes to win.”
                                During the 2004 Olympic Games, Perdita Felicien, a
                                Canadian and the reigning world champion in the hundredmeter hurdles, was heavily
                                favored to win the gold medal. In
                                the final race, she hit the first hurdle and fell hard. She wasn’t
                                able to complete the race. Extremely upset, she had tears in
                                her eyes as she lay there in bewilderment. She had prepared for
                                this moment six hours a day, every day of the week, for the
                                past four years. The next morning, I saw her news conference.
                                I wish I had taped it. It was amazing to listen to her
                                perspective. She said something to the effect of “I don’t know
                                why it happened but it did, and I’m going to use it. I’m going
                                to focus even more and work even harder for the next four
                                years. Who knows what my path would have been had I won?
                                Maybe it would have dulled my desire. I don’t know, but I do
                                know that now I’m hungrier than ever. I’ll be back even
                                stronger.” As I heard her speak, all I could say was “Wow!”
                                You can learn a lot from listening to champions.
                                Rich people hang around with winners. Poor people hang
                                around with losers. Why? It’s a matter of comfort. Rich peo-

                                ple are comfortable with other successful people. They feel
                                fully worthy of being with them. Poor people are uncomfortable with highly successful
                                people. They’re either afraid
                                they’ll be rejected or feel as if they don’t belong. To protect
                                itself, the ego then goes into judgment and criticism.
                                If you want to get rich, you will have to change your inner
                                blueprint to fully believe you are every bit as good as any
                                millionaire or multimillionaire out there. I’m shocked in my
                                seminars when people come up to me and ask if they can
                                touch me. They say, “I’ve never touched a multimillionaire
                                before.” I’m usually polite and smile, but in my mind I’m
                                saying, “Get a frickin’ life! I’m no better or different from you,
                                and unless you start to understand that, you’ll stay broke
                                forever!”
                                My friends, it’s not about “touching” millionaires, it’s about
                                deciding that you are just as good and worthy as they are, and
                                then acting like it. My best advice is this: if you really want to
                                touch a millionaire, become one!
                                I hope you get the point. Instead of mocking rich people,
                                model them. Instead of shying away from rich people, get to
                                know them. Instead of saying, “Wow, they’re so special,” say,
                                “If they can do it, I can do it.” Eventually, if you want to
                                touch a millionaire, you’ll be able to touch yourself !
                                DECLARATIONS: Place your hand on your heart and say...
                                “I model rich and successful people.”
                                “I associate with rich and successful people.”
                                “If they can do it, I can do it!”
                                Touch your head and say...
                                “I have a millionaire mind!”

                                MILLIONAIRE MIND ACTIONS
                                1. Go to the library, a bookstore, or the Internet and read a
                                biography of someone who is or was extremely rich and
                                successful. Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Mary
                                Kay, Donald Trump, Warren Buffett, Jack Welch, Bill
                                Gates, and Ted Turner are some good examples. Use their
                                story for inspiration, for learning specific success strategies,
                                and most importantly, for copying their mind-set.
                                2. Join a high-end club, such as for tennis, health, business, or
                                golf. Mingle with rich people in a rich environment. Or, if
                                there’s no way you can afford to join a high-end club, have
                                coffee or tea in the classiest hotel in your city. Get
                                comfortable in this atmosphere and watch the patrons,
                                noticing they’re no different from you.
                                3. Identify a situation or a person who is a downer in your life.
                                Remove yourself from that situation or association. If it’s
                                family, choose to be around them less.
                                4. Stop watching trash TV and stay away from bad news. </p>

                            <p>My company, Peak Potentials Training, offers over a dozen
                                different programs. During the initial seminar, usually the
                                102 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                Millionaire Mind Intensive, we briefly mention a few of our
                                other courses, then offer the participants special “at seminar”
                                tuition rates and bonuses. It’s interesting to note the reactions.
                                Most people are thrilled. They appreciate getting to hear
                                what the other courses are about and to receive the special
                                pricing. Some people, however, are not so thrilled. They resent
                                any promotion regardless of how it might benefit them. If this
                                sounds in any way like you, it’s an important characteristic to
                                notice about yourself.
                                Resenting promotion is one of the greatest obstacles to
                                success. People who have issues with selling and promotion
                                are usually broke. It’s obvious. How can you create a large
                                income in your own business or as a representative of one if
                                you aren’t willing to let people know that you, your product, or
                                your service exists? Even as an employee, if you aren’t willing
                                to promote your virtues, someone who is willing will quickly
                                bypass you on the corporate ladder.
                                People have a problem with promotion or sales for several
                                reasons. Chances are you might recognize one or more of the
                                following.
                                First, you may have had a bad experience in the past with
                                people promoting to you inappropriately. Maybe you perceived they were doing the “hard”
                                sell on you. Maybe they
                                were bothering you at an inopportune time. Maybe they
                                wouldn’t take no for an answer. In any case, it’s important to
                                recognize that this experience is in the past and that holding
                                on to it may not be serving you today.
                                Second, you may have had a disempowering experience
                                when you tried to sell something to someone and that person
                                totally rejected you. In this instance, your distaste for
                                promotion is merely a projection of your own fear of failure
                                The Wealth Files - 103
                                and rejection. Again, realize the past does not necessarily equal
                                the future.
                                Third, your issue might come from past parental programming. Many of us were told that
                                it’s impolite to “toot
                                your own horn.” Well, that’s great if you make a living as Miss
                                Manners. But in the real world, when it comes to business and
                                money, if you don’t toot your horn, I guarantee nobody will.
                                Rich people are willing to extol their virtues and value to
                                anyone who will listen and hopefully do business with them as
                                well.
                                Finally, some people feel that promotion is beneath them. I
                                call this the high-and-mighty syndrome, otherwise known as
                                the “Aren’t I so special?” attitude. The feeling in this case is
                                that if people want what you have, they should somehow find
                                and come to you. People who have this belief are either broke
                                or soon will be, that’s for sure. They can hope that everyone’s
                                going to scour the land searching for them, but the truth is
                                that the marketplace is crowded with products and services,
                                and even though theirs may be the best, no one will ever know
                                that because they’re too snooty to tell anyone.
                                You’re probably familiar with the saying “Build a better
                                mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door.” Well,
                                that’s only true if you add five words: “if they know about it.”
                                Rich people are almost always excellent promoters. They
                                can and are willing to promote their products, their services,
                                and their ideas with passion and enthusiasm. What’s more,
                                they’re skilled at packaging their value in a way that’s extremely
                                attractive. If you think there’s something wrong with that, then
                                let’s ban makeup for women, and while we’re at it, we might as
                                well get rid of suits for men. All that is nothing more than
                                “packaging.”
                                104 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                Robert Kiyosaki, best-selling author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad (a
                                book I highly recommend), points out that every business,
                                including writing books, depends on selling. He notes that he
                                is recognized as a best-selling author, not a best-writing author.
                                One pays a lot more than the other.
                                Rich people are usually leaders, and all great leaders are
                                great promoters. To be a leader, you must inherently have
                                followers and supporters, which means that you have to be
                                adept at selling, inspiring, and motivating people to buy into
                                your vision. Even the president of the United States of
                                America has to continuously sell his ideas to the people, to
                                Congress, and even to his own party, to have them implemented. And way before all of
                                that takes place, if he doesn’t
                                sell himself in the first place, he’ll never even get elected.
                                In short, any leader who can’t or won’t promote will not be
                                a leader for long, be it in politics, business, sports, or even as a
                                parent. I’m harping on this because leaders earn a heck of a lot
                                more money than followers!
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                Leaders earn a heck of a lot more money than
                                followers!
                                The critical point here isn’t whether you like to promote or
                                not, it is why you’re promoting. It boils down to your beliefs.
                                Do you really believe in your value? Do you really believe in
                                the product or service you’re offering? Do you really believe
                                that what you have will be of benefit to whomever you’re
                                promoting it to?
                                If you believe in your value, how could it possibly be ap-

                                propriate to hide it from people who need it? Suppose you had
                                a cure for arthritis, and you met someone who was suffering
                                and in pain with the disease. Would you hide it from him or
                                her? Would you wait for that person to read your mind or
                                guess that you have a product that could help? What would
                                you think of someone who didn’t offer suffering people their
                                opportunity because they were too shy, too afraid, or too cool
                                to promote?
                                More often than not, people who have a problem with
                                promotion don’t fully believe in their product or don’t fully
                                believe in themselves. Consequently, it’s difficult for them to
                                imagine that other people believe so strongly in their value that
                                they want to share it with everyone who comes their way and
                                in any way they can.
                                If you believe that what you have to offer can truly assist
                                people, it’s your duty to let as many people as possible know
                                about it. In this way, you not only help people, you get rich!
                                DECLARATION: Place your hand on your heart and say...
                                “I promote my value to others with passion and
                                enthusiasm.”
                                Touch your head and say...
                                “I have a millionaire mind!”

                                1. Rate the product or service you are currently offering (or
                                you are planning to offer) from 1 to 10 in terms of how
                                much you believe in its value (1 being the lowest, 10
                                being the highest). If your rating result is 7–9,

                                revise your product or service to increase the value. If
                                your result is 6 or below, stop offering that product or
                                service and start representing something you truly
                                believe in.
                                2. Read books, listen to audios and CDs, and take courses
                                on marketing and sales. Become an expert in both of
                                these arenas to a point where you can promote your
                                value successfully and with 100 percent integrity.</p>

                            <p>As I said earlier, getting rich is not a stroll in the park. It is a
                                journey that is full of twists, turns, detours, and obstacles. The
                                road to wealth is fraught with traps and pitfalls, and that’s
                                precisely why most people don’t take it. They don’t want the
                                hassles, the headaches, and the responsibilities. In short, they
                                don’t want the problems.
                                Therein lies one of the biggest differences between rich
                                people and poor people. Rich and successful people are bigger
                                than their problems, while poor and unsuccessful people are
                                smaller than their problems.
                                Poor people will do almost anything to avoid problems.
                                They see a challenge and they run. The irony is that in their
                                quest to make sure they don’t have problems, they have the
                                biggest problem of all... they’re broke and miserable. The
                                secret to success, my friends, is not to try to avoid or get rid of
                                or shrink from your problems; the secret is to grow yourself so
                                that you are bigger than any problem.

                                The secret to success is not to try to avoid
                                or get rid of or shrink from your problems;
                                the secret is to grow yourself so that
                                you are bigger than any problem.
                                On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the lowest, imagine you are a
                                person with a level 2 strength of character and attitude looking
                                at a level 5 problem. Would this problem appear to be big or
                                little? From a level 2 perspective, a level 5 problem would
                                seem like a big problem.
                                Now imagine you’ve grown yourself and become a level 8
                                person. Would the same level 5 problem be a big problem or a
                                little problem? Magically, the identical problem is now a little
                                problem.
                                Finally, imagine you’ve really worked hard on yourself and
                                become a level 10 person. Now, is this same level 5 problem a
                                big problem or a little problem? The answer is that it’s no
                                problem. It doesn’t even register in your brain as a problem.
                                There’s no negative energy around it. It’s just a normal
                                occurrence to handle, like brushing your teeth or getting
                                dressed.
                                Note that whether you are rich or poor, playing big or
                                playing small, problems do not go away. If you’re breathing,
                                you will always have so-called problems and obstacles in your
                                life. Let me make this short and sweet. The size of the
                                problem is never the issue—what matters is the size of you!
                                This may be painful, but if you’re ready to move to the next
                                level of success, you’re going to have to become conscious of
                                what’s really going on in your life. Ready? Here goes.
                                108 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                If you have a big problem in your life, all that means is that
                                you are being a small person! Don’t be fooled by appearances.
                                Your outer world is merely a reflection of your inner world. If
                                you want to make a permanent change, stop focusing on the
                                size of your problems and start focusing on the size of you!
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                If you have a big problem in your life, all that
                                means is that you are being a small person!
                                One of the not-so-subtle reminders I give participants at my
                                seminar is this: whenever you feel as if you’ve got a big
                                problem, point to yourself and scream, “Mini me, mini me,
                                mini me!” That will abruptly wake you up and move your
                                attention back to where it belongs—on yourself. Then, coming
                                from your “higher self ” (rather than your ego-based, victim
                                self ), take a deep breath and decide right now, in this very
                                moment, you will be a bigger person and not allow any
                                problem or obstacle to take you out of either your happiness
                                or success.
                                The bigger the problems you can handle, the bigger the
                                business you can handle; the bigger the responsibility you can
                                handle, the more employees you can handle; the more
                                customers you can handle, the more money you can handle,
                                and ultimately, the more wealth you can handle.
                                Again, your wealth can only grow to the extent that you do!
                                The objective is to grow yourself to a place where you can
                                overcome any problems or obstacles that get in the way of
                                your creating wealth and keeping it once you have it.
                                By the way, keeping your wealth is a whole other world.
                                The Wealth Files - 109
                                Who knew? I sure didn’t. I thought that once you made it, you
                                made it! Boy, was I in for a rude awakening as I proceeded to
                                lose my first million almost as fast as I made it. Now, in
                                hindsight, I understand what the issue was. At the time, my
                                “toolbox” wasn’t yet big and strong enough to hold the wealth
                                I had achieved. Again, thank goodness I practiced the
                                principles of the Millionaire Mind and was able to recondition
                                myself ! Not only did I make that million back, but because of
                                my new “money blueprint,” I’ve made millions and millions
                                more. Best of all, I’ve not only kept it, but it keeps growing at a
                                phenomenal rate!
                                Think of yourself as your container for wealth. If your
                                container is small and your money is big, what’s going to
                                happen? You will lose it. Your container will overflow and the
                                excess money will spill out all over the place. You simply
                                cannot have more money than the container. Therefore you
                                must grow to be a big container so you cannot only hold more
                                wealth but also attract more wealth. The universe abhors a
                                vacuum and if you have a very large money container, it will
                                rush in to fill the space.
                                One of the reasons rich people are bigger than their problems goes back to what we
                                discussed earlier. They don’t focus
                                on the problem; they focus on their goal. Again, the mind
                                generally focuses on one predominant thing at a time. Meaning
                                that either you are whining about the problem or you are
                                working on the solution. Rich and successful people are
                                solution-oriented; they spend their time and energy strategizing
                                and planning the answers to challenges that come up, and

                                Poor and unsuccessful people are problem-oriented. They
                                spend their time and energy bitching and complaining and
                                110 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                seldom come up with anything creative to alleviate the problem, let alone make sure it
                                doesn’t happen again.
                                Rich people do not back away from problems, do not avoid
                                problems, and do not complain about problems. Rich people
                                are financial warriors. In our Enlightened Warrior Training
                                Camp, the definition of a warrior we use is “one who conquers
                                oneself.”
                                The bottom line is that if you become a master at handling
                                problems and overcoming any obstacle, what can stop you
                                from success? The answer is nothing ! And if nothing can stop
                                you, you become unstoppable ! And if you become unstoppable,
                                what choices do you have in your life? The answer is all
                                choices. If you are unstoppable, anything and everything is
                                available to you. You simply choose it and it’s yours! How’s
                                that for freedom!
                                DECLARATIONS: Place your hand on your heart and say...
                                “I am bigger than any problems.”
                                “I can handle any problems.”
                                Touch your head and say...
                                “I have a millionaire mind!”
                                MILLIONAIRE MIND ACTIONS
                                1. Whenever you are feeling upset over a “big” problem, point
                                to yourself and say, “Mini me, mini me.” Then take a deep
                                breath and say to yourself, “I can handle this. I am bigger
                                than any problem.”
                                2. Write down a problem you are having in your life. Then list
                                ten specific actions you can take to resolve or at least
                                improve this situation. This will move you from problem
                                thinking into solution thinking.

                            <p>If I had to nail down the number one reason most people do
                                not reach their full financial potential, it would be this: most
                                people are poor “receivers.” They may or may not be good at
                                giving, but they are definitely bad at receiving. And because
                                they are poor at receiving, they don’t!
                                People are challenged by receiving for several reasons. First,
                                many people feel unworthy or undeserving. This syndrome
                                runs rampant in our society. I would guess that over 90
                                percent of individuals have feelings of not being good enough
                                running through their veins.
                                Where does this low self-esteem come from? The usual—
                                our conditioning. For most of us it comes from hearing twenty
                                nos for every yes, ten “You’re doing it wrong”s for every
                                “You’re doing it right,” and five “You’re stupid”s for every
                                “You’re awesome.”
                                Even if our parents or guardians were incredibly supportive,
                                many of us end up with feelings of not being able to
                                continually measure up to their accolades and expectations. So
                                once again, we’re not good enough.
                                In addition, most of us grew up with the element of punishment in our lives. This
                                unwritten rule simply states that if
                                you do something wrong, you will or should be punished.
                                Some of us were punished by our parents, some by our
                                112 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                teachers... and some of us in certain religious circles were
                                threatened with the mother of all punishments, not getting
                                into heaven.
                                Of course, now that we’re adults, all this is over. Right?
                                Wrong! For most people, the conditioning of punishment is so
                                ingrained that, because there’s no one around to punish them,
                                when they make a mistake or just aren’t perfect, they
                                subconsciously punish themselves. When they were young,
                                this punishment might have come in the form of “You were
                                bad, so no candy.” Today, however, it could take the form of
                                “You were bad, so no money.” This explains why some people
                                limit their earnings, and why others will subconsciously
                                sabotage their success.
                                No wonder people have difficulty receiving. One tiny
                                mistake and you’re doomed to carry the burden of misery and
                                poverty for the rest of your life. “A little harsh,” you say? Since
                                when did the mind become logical or compassionate? Again,
                                the conditioned mind is a file folder filled with past
                                programming, made-up meanings, and stories of drama and
                                disaster. “Making sense” is not its strong suit.
                                Here’s something I teach in my seminars that might make
                                you feel better. In the end, it doesn’t matter whether you feel
                                worthy or not, you can be rich either way. Plenty of wealthy
                                people don’t feel overly worthy. In fact, it’s one of the major
                                motivations for people to get rich...to prove themselves and
                                their worth to themselves or to others. The idea that selfworth is necessary for net
                                worth is just that, an idea, but it
                                doesn’t necessarily hold water in the real world. As we said
                                earlier, getting rich to prove yourself may not make you the
                                happiest camper, so you’re better off creating wealth for other
                                reasons. But what’s important here is for you to realize
                                The Wealth Files - 113
                                that your feeling of unworthiness won’t prevent you from
                                getting rich; from a strictly financial point of view this could
                                actually be a motivational asset.
                                Having said that, I want you to get what I’m going to share
                                with you, loud and clear. This could easily be one of the most
                                important moments of your life. Are you ready? Here goes.
                                Recognize that whether you are worthy or not is all a madeup “story.” Again, nothing has
                                meaning except for the
                                meaning we give it. I don’t know about you, but I’ve never
                                heard of anybody who went through the “stamping” lineup at
                                birth. Can you imagine God stamping each person’s forehead
                                as he or she came through? “Worthy...unworthy... worthy,
                                worthy...unworthy. Yuck...definitely unworthy.” Sorry, I don’t
                                think it works that way. There’s no one who comes around
                                and stamps you “worthy” or “unworthy.” You do that. You
                                make it up. You decide it. You and you alone determine if
                                you’re going to be worthy. It’s simply your perspective. If you
                                say you’re worthy, you are. If you say you’re not worthy, you’re
                                not. Either way you will live into your story. This is so critical,
                                I’m going to repeat that again: you will live into your story. It’s
                                that simple.
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                If you say you’re worthy, you are.
                                If you say you’re not worthy, you’re not.
                                Either way you will live into your story.
                                So why would people do this to themselves? Why would
                                people make up the story that they’re not worthy? It’s just
                                114 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                the nature of the human mind, the protective part of us that’s
                                always looking for what’s wrong. Ever notice that a squirrel
                                doesn’t worry about these things? Can you imagine a squirrel
                                saying, “I’m not going to collect many nuts this year to prepare
                                for winter because I’m not worthy?” Doubtful, because these
                                low-intelligence creatures would never do that to themselves.
                                Only the most evolved creature on the planet, the human
                                being, has the ability to limit itself like this.
                                One of my own sayings is “If a hundred-foot oak tree had
                                the mind of a human, it would only grow to be ten feet tall!”
                                So here’s my suggestion: since it’s a lot easier to change your
                                story than your worthiness, instead of worrying about
                                changing your worthiness, change your story. It’s a lot faster
                                and cheaper. Simply make up a new and much more supportive story and live into that.
                                “Oh, but I couldn’t do that,” you say. “I’m not qualified to
                                decide that I’m worthy. That has to come from someone else.”
                                Sorry, I say, that’s not quite accurate, which is a nice way of
                                saying “Bullpoo!” It wouldn’t make a difference what anyone
                                says or said in the past, because you have to believe it and buy
                                into it for it to have any effect and that can’t come from
                                anyone else but you. But just to make you feel better, let’s play
                                the game and I’ll do for you what I do for thousands of
                                participants at the Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar: I will
                                personally anoint you.

                                human, it would only grow to be ten feet tall!”

                                This is a special ceremony, so I’m going to ask you to
                                eliminate any distractions right now. Stop munching, stop
                                talking on the phone, and stop whatever you’re doing. Men, if
                                you like, you can change into a suit and tie, although a tuxedo
                                would be best. Women, a formal evening gown and heels
                                would be perfect. And if you don’t have anything that’s classy
                                or new enough, this would definitely be an occasion to go buy
                                yourself a brand-new dress, designer label preferred.
                                If you’re all ready, let’s begin. Please kneel down on one
                                knee and bow your head in respect. Ready, here goes. “BY
                                THE POWER INVESTED IN ME, I HEREBY ANOINT
                                YOU AS ‘WORTHY’ FROM NOW UNTIL FOREVER
                                MORE!”
                                Okay we’re done. You can stand up now and hold your
                                head high because you are finally worthy. Here’s some sage
                                advice: stop buying into that “worthiness” or “unworthiness”
                                crap and start taking the actions you need to take to get rich!
                                The second major reason most people have a problem with
                                receiving is that they have bought into the adage “It’s better to
                                give than to receive.” Let me put this as elegantly as possible:
                                “What a crock !” That statement is total hogwash, and in case
                                you haven’t noticed, it’s usually propagated by people and
                                groups who want you to give and them to receive.
                                The whole idea is ludicrous. What’s better, hot or cold, big
                                or small, left or right, in or out? Giving and receiving are two
                                sides of the same coin. Whoever decided that it is better to
                                give than to receive was simply bad at math. For every giver
                                there must be a receiver, and for every receiver there must be a
                                giver.
                                116 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                For every giver there must be a receiver,
                                and for every receiver there must be a giver.
                                Think about it! How could you give if there weren’t
                                someone or something there to receive? Both have to be in
                                perfect balance to work one to one, fifty-fifty. And since giving and receiving must
                                always equal each other, they must also
                                be equal in importance.
                                Besides, how does it feel to give? Most of us would agree
                                that giving feels wonderful and fulfilling. Conversely, how
                                does it feel when you want to give and the other person isn’t
                                willing to receive? Most of us would agree that it feels terrible.
                                So know this: if you are not willing to receive, then you are “ripping off
                                ” those who want to give to you.
                                You are actually denying them the joy and pleasure that
                                comes from giving; instead, they feel lousy. Why? Again,
                                everything is energy, and when you want to give but can’t, that
                                energy cannot be expressed and gets stuck in you. That
                                “stuck” energy then turns into negative emotions.
                                To make matters worse, when you are not willing to fully
                                receive, you are training the universe not to give to you! It’s
                                simple: if you aren’t willing to receive your share, it will go to
                                someone else who is. That’s one of the reasons the rich get
                                richer and the poor get poorer. Not because they’re any more
                                worthy, but because they are willing to receive while most
                                poor people are not.
                                I learned this lesson in a big way while camping by myself in
                                the forest. In preparation for my two-day sojourn I made
                                what’s called a lean-to. This means tying the top part of a tarp
                                to a tree and then fastening the bottom to the ground to
                                The Wealth Files - 117
                                create a forty-five-degree roof over my head when I slept.
                                Thank goodness I prepared this mini-condo because it rained
                                all night. When I came out of my shelter that morning, I was
                                noticing how dry I and everything else under the tarp was. At
                                the same time, however, I couldn’t help but notice this
                                unusually deep puddle that had collected at the bottom of the
                                tarp. All of a sudden I heard this inner voice say to me,
                                “Nature is totally abundant but not discriminating. When the
                                rain falls, it has to go somewhere. If one part is dry, another
                                part will be doubly wet.” As I stood over the puddle, I realized
                                this is exactly the way it works with money. There’s plenty of
                                it, trillions of trillions of dollars floating around, it’s in definite
                                abundance, and it has to go somewhere. The deal is this: if
                                somebody isn’t willing to receive his or her share, it must go to
                                whoever will. The rain doesn’t care who gets it and neither
                                does money.
                                At this point in the Millionaire Mind seminar I teach people
                                the special prayer I created after my experience under the tarp.
                                Of course it’s a little tongue-in-cheek, but the lesson is
                                obvious. It goes like this: “Universe, if anyone has something
                                great coming to them and they’re not willing to take it, send it
                                to me! I am open and willing to receive all of your blessings.
                                Thank you.” I have the entire audience repeat this with me and
                                they go crazy! They’re excited because it feels amazing to be
                                totally willing to receive, and it feels great because it’s totally
                                natural to do so. Anything you’ve made up to the contrary is,
                                again, just a “story” that isn’t serving you or anyone else. Let
                                your story go and your money come.
                                Rich people work hard and believe it’s perfectly appropriate
                                to be well rewarded for their efforts and the value they provide
                                for others. Poor people work hard, but due to their
                                118 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                feelings of unworthiness, they believe that it is inappropriate
                                for them to be well rewarded for their efforts and the value
                                they provide. This belief sets them up to be perfect victims,
                                and of course, how can you be a “good” victim if you are well
                                rewarded?
                                Many poor people actually believe they are better people
                                because they are poor. Somehow they believe they’re more
                                pious or spiritual or good. Baloney! The only thing poor
                                people are, is poor. I had a gentleman at the course come to
                                me in tears. He said, “I just don’t see how I could feel good
                                about having a lot of money when others have so little.” I
                                asked him a few simple questions: “What good do you do for
                                poor people by being one of them? Whom do you help by
                                being broke? Aren’t you just another mouth to feed? Wouldn’t
                                it be more effective for you to create wealth for yourself and
                                then be able to really help others from a place of strength
                                instead of weakness?”
                                He stopped crying and said, “For the first time, I got it. I
                                can’t believe what garbage I’ve been thinking. Harv, I believe
                                the time has come for me to get rich and, along the way, help
                                others. Thank you.” He went back to his seat a new man. I got
                                an e-mail from him not long ago telling me he’s making ten
                                times what he used to earn and that he’s feeling awesome
                                about it. Best of all, he says, it feels tremendous to be able to
                                assist some of his friends and family who are still struggling.
                                This leads me to an important point: if you have the
                                wherewithal to have a lot of money, have it. Why? Because the
                                truth is that we are extremely fortunate to be living in this
                                society, a society whereby each person is in fact rich compared
                                to many other parts of the world. Some people just don’t ever
                                have the opportunity to have a lot of money. If you are one of
                                the lucky people who do have that ability,
                                The Wealth Files - 119
                                and each of you is or you wouldn’t be reading a book like this,
                                then use your wherewithal for all it’s worth. Get really rich and
                                then help people who don’t have the opportunity you did.
                                That makes a lot more sense to me than being broke and
                                helping no one.
                                Of course there are the people who will say, “Money will
                                change me. If I get rich, I might turn into some kind of greedy
                                jerk.” First, the only people who say that are poor people. It’s
                                just another justification for their failure, and it comes from
                                just another one of the many “inner” weeds in their financial
                                garden. Don’t buy it!
                                Second, let me set the record straight. Money will only make
                                you more of what you already are. If you’re mean, money will afford
                                you the opportunity to be meaner. If you’re kind, money will
                                afford you the opportunity to be kinder. If you’re a jerk at
                                heart, with money you can be jerkier. (I know there’s no such
                                word, but if you were a real jerk, you’d find a way.) If you’re
                                generous, more money will simply allow you to be more
                                generous. And anyone who tells you different is broke !
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                Money will only make you
                                more of what you already are.
                                So what to do? How do you become a good receiver?
                                First, begin to nurture yourself. Remember, people are
                                creatures of habit, and therefore you will have to consciously
                                practice receiving the best life has to offer.
                                One of the key elements in the money management system
                                we teach in the Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar is
                                120 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                having a “play” account where you get to blow a designated
                                amount of money on things that nurture you and allow you to
                                “feel like a million.” The idea of this account is to help you
                                validate your worthiness and strengthen your “receiving
                                muscle.”
                                Second, I want you to practice going crazy with excitement
                                and gratitude anytime you find or receive any money. It’s
                                funny, when I was broke and I saw a penny on the ground, I
                                would never stoop so low as to pick up a lowly penny. Now
                                that I’m rich, however, I pick up anything that even looks like
                                money. Then I give it a kiss for good luck and declare out
                                loud, “I am a money magnet. Thank you, thank you, thank
                                you.”
                                I don’t stand there judging the denomination. Money is
                                money, and finding money is a blessing from the universe.
                                Now that I’m fully willing to receive anything and everything
                                that comes my way, I do!
                                Being open and willing to receive is absolutely critical if you
                                want to create wealth. It’s also critical if you want to keep it. If
                                you are a poor receiver and you somehow fall into a substantial amount of money, chances
                                are it’ll be gone quickly.
                                Again, “first the inner, then the outer.” First, expand your receiving “box.” Then watch
                                as the money comes in to fill it.
                                Again, the universe abhors a vacuum. In other words, an
                                empty space will always be filled. Have you ever noticed what
                                happens with an empty closet or garage? It usually doesn’t stay
                                empty for long, does it? Have you also noticed how strange it
                                is that the time taken for any task will always be equal to the
                                time given? Once you expand your capacity to receive, you
                                will.
                                Also, once you become truly open to receiving, the rest of
                                your life will open up. Not only will you receive more
                                The Wealth Files - 121
                                money, but you’ll also receive more love, more peace, more
                                happiness, and more fulfillment. Why? Because of another
                                principle I constantly use that states, “How you do anything is
                                how you do everything.”
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                How you do anything is how you do everything.
                                The way you are in one area is usually the way you are in all
                                areas. If you’ve been blocking yourself from receiving money,
                                chances are you’ve been blocking yourself from receiving
                                everything else that’s good in life. The mind doesn’t usually
                                delineate specifically where you are a poor receiver. In fact, it’s
                                just the opposite: the mind has a habit of overgeneralizing and
                                says, “The way it is, is the way it is, everywhere and always.”
                                If you’re a poor receiver, you’re a poor receiver in all areas.
                                The good news is that when you become an excellent receiver,
                                you’ll be an excellent receiver everywhere...and open to
                                receiving all that the universe has to offer in all areas of your
                                life.
                                Now the only thing you’ll have to remember is to keep
                                saying “Thank you” as you receive all of your blessings.
                                DECLARATION: Place your hand on your heart and say...
                                “I am an excellent receiver. I am open and willing to
                                receive massive amounts of money into my life.”
                                Touch your head and say...
                                “I have a millionaire mind!”
                                122 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                MILLIONAIRE MIND ACTIONS
                                1. Practice being an excellent receiver. Each time someone
                                gives you a compliment of any sort, simply say, “Thank
                                you.” Do not return a compliment to that person at the
                                same time. This allows you to fully receive and own the
                                compliment instead of “deflecting” it, as most people do.
                                This also allows the giver of the compliment the joy of
                                giving the gift without it being thrown back at them.
                                2. Any, and I mean any, money you find or receive should
                                enthusiastically be celebrated. Go ahead and scream out,
                                “I’m a money magnet. Thank you, thank you, thank you.”
                                This goes for money you find on the ground, for money
                                you get as gifts, for money you get from the government,
                                for money you get as a paycheck, and for money you get
                                from your business. Remember, the universe is set up to
                                support you. If you keep declaring that you are a money
                                magnet, and especially if you have the proof, the universe
                                will simply say, “Okay,” and send you more.
                                3. Pamper yourself. At least once a month do something
                                special to nurture yourself and your spirit. Get a massage,
                                a manicure, or a pedicure, take yourself for an extravagant
                                lunch or dinner, rent a boat or a weekend cottage, have
                                someone bring you breakfast in bed. (You might have to
                                trade with a friend or family member.) Do things that will
                                allow you to feel rich and deserving. Again, the vibrational
                                energy you emit from this kind of experience will send a
                                message to the universe that you live abundantly, and
                                again, the universe will simply do its job and say, “Okay,”
                                and give you opportunities for more. </p>

                            <p>Have you ever heard this advice: “Go to school, get good
                                grades, get a good job, get a steady paycheck, be on time, work
                                hard . . . and you’ll live happily ever after”? I don’t know about
                                you, but I’d sure love to see the written guarantee on that one.
                                Unfortunately, this sage advice comes directly from the Book of
                                Fairy Tales, Volume I, right after the tooth fairy story.
                                I’m not going to bother debunking the entire statement.
                                You can do that for yourself by checking your own experience
                                and the lives of everyone around you. What I will discuss is the
                                idea behind the “steady” paycheck. There’s nothing wrong
                                with getting a steady paycheck, unless it interferes with your
                                ability to earn what you’re worth. There’s the rub. It usually
                                does.
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                There’s nothing wrong with getting a steady
                                paycheck, unless it interferes with your ability

                                It usually does.
                                Poor people prefer to be paid a steady salary or hourly wage.
                                They need the “security” of knowing that exactly the
                                124 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                same amount of money is coming in at exactly the same time,
                                month in, month out. What they don’t realize is that this
                                security comes with a price, and the cost is wealth.
                                Living based in security is living based in fear. What you’re
                                actually saying is “I’m afraid I won’t be able to earn enough
                                based on my performance, so I’ll settle for earning just enough
                                to survive or to be comfortable.”
                                Rich people prefer to get paid based on the results they
                                produce, if not totally, then at least partially. Rich people
                                usually own their own business in some form. They make their
                                income from their profits. Rich people work on commission
                                or percentages of revenue. Rich people choose stock options
                                and profit sharing in lieu of higher salaries. Notice there are no
                                guarantees with any of the above. As stated earlier, in the
                                financial world the rewards are usually proportionate to the
                                risk.
                                Rich people believe in themselves. They believe in their
                                value and in their ability to deliver it. Poor people don’t. That’s
                                why they need “guarantees.”
                                Recently, I dealt with a public relations consultant who
                                wanted me to pay her a fee of $4,000 per month. I asked her
                                what I’d receive for my $4,000. She replied that I’d see at least
                                $20,000 of coverage per month in the media. I said, “What if
                                you don’t produce those results or anything close to it?” She
                                answered that she would still be putting in the time, so she
                                deserved to get paid.
                                I replied, “I’m not interested in paying for your time. I’m
                                interested in paying you for a specific result, and if you don’t
                                produce that result, why should I pay you? On the other hand,
                                if you produce even greater results, you should get paid more.
                                Tell you what: I’ll give you fifty percent of whatever media
                                value you produce. According to your figures,
                                The Wealth Files - 125
                                that would mean paying you ten thousand dollars per month,
                                which is more than double your fee.”
                                Did she go for it? Nope! Is she broke? Yup! And she will be
                                for the rest of her life or until she figures out that to get rich
                                you will need to be paid based on results.

                                this strategy is that your time is limited. This means that you
                                invariably end up breaking Wealth Rule #1, which states,
                                “Never have a ceiling on your income.” If you choose to get
                                paid for your time, you are pretty much killing your chances
                                for wealth.
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                Never have a ceiling on your income.
                                This rule also applies to personal service businesses, where,
                                again, you generally get paid for your time. That’s why lawyers,
                                accountants, and consultants who are not yet partners in their
                                firm—and therefore don’t share in the business profits—make
                                a moderate living at best.
                                Suppose you are in the pen business and you get an order
                                for fifty thousand pens. If this were the case, what would you
                                do? You’d simply call your supplier, order fifty thousand pens,
                                send them off, and happily count your profits. On the other
                                hand, suppose you are a massage therapist and you’re
                                fortunate enough to have fifty thousand people lined up
                                outside your door all wanting a massage from you. What do
                                you do? You kill yourself for not being in the pen business.
                                What else can you do? Try explaining to the last person in line
                                that you may be running “a little late,” as in their appointment
                                is Tuesday at 3:15, four decades from now!
                                126 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                I’m not suggesting there’s anything wrong with being in a
                                personal service business. Just don’t expect to get rich anytime
                                soon unless you create a way to duplicate or leverage yourself.
                                At my seminars, I often meet salaried or hourly wage employees who complain to me that
                                they’re not getting paid what
                                they’re worth. My response is “In whose opinion? I’m sure
                                your boss thinks you’re being compensated fairly. Why don’t
                                you get off the salary treadmill and ask to be paid based fully
                                or partially on your performance? Or, if that is not possible,
                                why not work for yourself ? Then you’ll know you’re making
                                exactly what you’re worth.” Somehow, this advice doesn’t
                                seem to appease these people, who are obviously terrified of
                                testing their “true” value in the marketplace.
                                The fear most people have of being paid based on their
                                results is often just a fear of breaking out of their old conditioning. In my
                                experience, most people who are stuck in the
                                steady-paycheck rut have past programming that tells them
                                this is the “normal” way to get paid for your work.
                                You can’t blame your parents. (I guess you can if you’re a
                                good victim.) Most parents tend to be overly protective, so it’s
                                only natural for them to want their kids to have a secure
                                existence. As you’ve probably already found out, any work that
                                doesn’t provide a steady paycheck usually produces the
                                infamous parental response “When are you going to get a real
                                job?”
                                I remember, when my parents asked me that question,
                                thank goodness my reply was “Hopefully never!” My mother
                                was devastated. My father, however, said, “Good for you.
                                You’ll never get rich working on straight salary for someone
                                else. If you’re going to get a job, make sure you get paid on
                                percentage. Otherwise, go work for yourself !”
                                The Wealth Files - 127
                                I too encourage you to work “for yourself.” Start your own
                                business, work on commission, get a percentage of revenue or
                                company profits, or get stock options. Whatever your vehicle,
                                make certain you create a situation that allows you to get paid
                                based on your results.
                                Personally, I believe just about everyone should own their
                                own business, be it full-time or part-time. The first reason is
                                that by far, the vast majority of millionaires became rich by being in their
                                own business.
                                Secondly, it’s extremely difficult to create wealth when the
                                tax man is grabbing almost half of everything you earn. When
                                you own a business, you can save a small fortune in taxes by
                                writing off a portion of your expenses for such things as your
                                car, travel, education, and even your home. For that reason
                                alone, it’s worth having your own business.
                                If you don’t have a brilliant business idea, not to worry: you
                                can use someone else’s. First, you can become a commissioned
                                salesperson. Selling is one of the world’s highest-paid
                                professions. If you’re good, you can earn a fortune. Second,
                                you can join a network marketing company. There are dozens
                                of excellent ones, and they have in place all of the products
                                and systems you need to get started immediately. For just a
                                few bucks, you can become a distributor and have all the
                                benefits of owning a business with few of the administrative
                                hassles.
                                If it resonates with you, network marketing can be a dynamite vehicle for wealth. But,
                                and this is a big but, don’t think
                                for a minute that you’re going to get a free ride. Network
                                marketing will only work if you do. It will take training, time,
                                and energy to succeed. But if you do, incomes in the range of
                                $20,000 to $50,000 per month—that’s right, per month—are
                                not uncommon. In any case, just signing
                                128 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                up and becoming a part-time distributor will give you some
                                excellent tax advantages, and who knows, maybe you’ll enjoy
                                the product enough to offer it to others and end up making a
                                nice income to boot.
                                Another option is exchanging your “job” for a “contract”
                                position. If your employer is willing, he or she can hire your
                                company instead of you to do basically what you’re doing now.
                                A few legal requirements have to be fulfilled, but for the most
                                part, if you add one or two more clients, even part-time, you
                                can get paid as a business owner instead of an employee and
                                enjoy business-owner tax benefits. Who knows, those parttime clients may grow to become
                                full-time clients, which
                                would then give you the opportunity to leverage yourself, hire
                                other people to get all the work done, and eventually you’ll be
                                running your own full-on business.
                                You might think, “My employer would never go for that.” I
                                wouldn’t be too sure about that. You have to understand, it
                                costs a company a fortune to have an employee. Not only do
                                they have to pay salary or wages, but they have to pay a whack
                                of money on top of that to the government, often to the tune
                                of 25 percent or more above what the employee earns. Add to
                                that the cost of the benefits package that most employees get,
                                and you’ve probably got a 50 percent savings to a company
                                that chooses to hire you as an independent consultant. Of
                                course you won’t be eligible for many of the benefits you got
                                as an employee, but for what you save in taxes alone, you can
                                buy the best of what you need on your own.
                                In the end, the only way to earn what you’re really worth is
                                to get paid based on your results. Once again, my dad said it
                                best: “You’ll never get rich working on straight salary for
                                The Wealth Files - 129
                                someone else. If you’re going to get a job, make sure you get
                                paid on percentage. Otherwise, go work for yourself !”
                                Now that’s sage advice!
                                DECLARATION: Place your hand on your heart and say...
                                “I choose to get paid based on my results.”
                                Touch your head and say...
                                “I have a millionaire mind!”

                                1. If you are currently in a job getting paid based on an
                                hourly wage or salary, create and propose a compensation plan to your employer that
                                would allow you to get
                                paid at least partly based on your individual results as well
                                as the results of the company.
                                If you own your own business, create a compensation
                                plan that allows your employees or even primary sup
                                pliers to get paid based more on their results and the
                                results of your company.
                                Put these plans into action immediately.
                                2. If you are currently in a job and not being paid what
                                you are worth based on the results you are producing,

                                what you know, or offer your independent consulting

                                but this time, paid on performance and results rather
                                than only for your time.

                                Success Story from Sean Nita
                                Dear Harv,
                                I can’t explain how grateful we are that we were introduced to you by one of my wife’s
                                friends. At the time I’d
                                just received a $10,000 cut in pay. We were desperately
                                looking for options, as we were not making ends meet
                                anymore.
                                At the Millionaire Mind Intensive, we learned the tools
                                that helped us create financial freedom. Once we put the
                                tools in place, miracles started to happen. We were able to
                                purchase five homes within the next year. All with a
                                minimum profit of at least $18,000 each. The fifth house had
                                a profit of $300,000, six times my previous yearly salary! I
                                was able to quit my job of fourteen years and become a fulltime real estate investor,
                                giving me the free time to be with
                                my family and friends.
                                Your method of teaching at the cellular level has been a
                                great key to our success. I cannot wait for what is ahead. I
                                only wish I’d learned this when I was in my twenties.
                                Thank you.
                                Sincerely,

                            <p>Rich people live in a world of abundance. Poor people live in a
                                world of limitations. Of course, both live in the same physical
                                world, but the difference is in their perspective. Poor and most
                                middle-class people come from scarcity. They live by mottos
                                such as “There’s only so much to go around, there’s never
                                enough, and you can’t have everything.” And although you
                                may not be able to have “everything,” as in all the things in the
                                world, I do think you can certainly have “everything you really
                                want.”
                                Do you want a successful career or a close relationship with
                                your family? Both! Do you want to focus on business or have
                                fun and play? Both! Do you want money or meaning in your
                                life? Both! Do you want to earn a fortune or do the work you
                                love? Both! Poor people always choose one, rich people
                                choose both.
                                Rich people understand that with a little creativity you can
                                almost always figure out a way to have the best of both worlds.
                                From now on, when confronted with an either/or alternative,
                                the quintessential question to ask yourself is “How can I have
                                both?” This question will change your life. It will take you
                                from a model of scarcity and limitation to a universe of
                                possibilities and abundance.
                                This doesn’t just pertain to things you want, it pertains to all
                                areas of life. For example, right now, I’m preparing to deal
                                with an unhappy supplier that believes my company, Peak
                                Potentials, should pay for certain expenses they’ve had that
                                weren’t originally agreed to. My feeling is that estimat-

                                ing his costs is his business not mine, and if he’s incurred
                                higher expenses, that’s something he has to deal with. I’m
                                more than willing to negotiate a new agreement for next time,
                                but I’m big on keeping agreements that were already made.
                                Now in my “broke” days, I’d go into this discussion with the
                                goal of making my point and making sure I don’t pay this guy
                                one cent more than we agreed upon. And even though I’d like
                                to keep him as a supplier, this would probably end up in a
                                huge argument. I’d go in thinking either he wins or I win.
                                Today, however, because I’ve trained myself to think in
                                terms of “both,” I’m going into this discussion completely
                                open to creating a situation where I’m not going to pay him
                                any more money and he’s going to be extremely happy with the
                                arrangements we do make. In other words, my goal is to have
                                both !
                                Here’s another example. Several months ago I decided to
                                purchase a vacation home in Arizona. I scoured the area I was
                                interested in, and every real estate agent told me, if I wanted
                                three bedrooms plus a den in that vicinity, I’d have to pay over
                                a million dollars. My intention was to keep my investment in
                                this home under a million. Most people would either lower
                                their expectations or raise their budget. I held out for both. I
                                recently got a call that the owners of a house in the exact
                                location I wanted, with the number of rooms I wanted, had
                                reduced their price $200,000 to under a million. Here is
                                another tribute to the intention of having both!
                                Finally, I always told my parents that I didn’t want to slave
                                away at work I didn’t enjoy and that I would “get rich doing
                                what I love.” Their response was the usual: “You’re living in a
                                dream world. Life is not a bowl of cherries.” They said,
                                The Wealth Files - 133
                                “Business is business, pleasure is pleasure. First you take
                                care of making a living, then, if there’s any time left over, you
                                can enjoy your life.”
                                I remember thinking to myself, “Hmm, if I listen to them,
                                I’ll end up like them. No. I’m gonna have both!” Was it tough?
                                You bet. Sometimes I’d have to work at a job I hated for a
                                week or two so I could eat and pay the rent. But I never lost
                                my intention of having “both.” I never got stuck long-term in
                                a job or business I didn’t like. Eventually I did become rich
                                doing what I loved. Now that I know it can be done, I
                                continue to pursue only the work and projects that I love. Best
                                of all, I now have the privilege of teaching others to do the
                                same.
                                Nowhere is “both” thinking more important than when it
                                comes to money. Poor and many middle-class people believe
                                that they have to choose between money and the other aspects
                                of life. Consequently they’ve rationalized a position that
                                money is not as important as other things.
                                Let’s set the record straight. Money is important! To say
                                that it’s not as important as any of the other things in life is
                                ludicrous. What’s more important, your arm or your leg?
                                Could it be that both are important?
                                Money is a lubricant. It enables you to “slide” through life
                                instead of having to “scrape” by. Money brings freedom—
                                freedom to buy what you want, and freedom to do what you
                                want with your time. Money allows you to enjoy the finer
                                things in life as well as giving you the opportunity to help
                                others have the necessities in life. Most of all, having money
                                allows you not to have to spend your energy worrying about
                                not having money.
                                Happiness is important too. Again, here’s where poor and
                                middle-class people get confused. Many believe money and
                                134 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                happiness are mutually exclusive, that either you can be rich or
                                you can be happy. Again, this is nothing more than “poor”
                                programming.
                                People who are rich in every sense of the word understand
                                that you have to have both. Just as you have to have both your
                                arms and your legs, you have to have money and happiness.
                                You Can Have Your Cake and Eat It Too!
                                So here’s another major difference between rich people,
                                middle-class people, and poor people:
                                Rich people believe “You can have your cake and eat it
                                too.”
                                Middle-class people believe “Cake is too rich, so I’ll only
                                have a little piece.”
                                Poor people don’t believe they deserve cake, so they order a
                                doughnut, focus on the hole, and wonder why they have
                                “nothing.”
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                Rich people believe
                                “You can have your cake and eat it too.”
                                Middle-class people believe
                                “Cake is too rich, so I’ll only have a little piece.”
                                Poor people don’t believe they deserve cake,
                                so they order a doughnut, focus on the hole,
                                and wonder why they have “nothing.”
                                I ask you, what is the use of having your “cake” if you can’t eat
                                it? What exactly are you supposed to do with it? Put
                                The Wealth Files - 135
                                it on your mantel and look at it? Cake is meant to be eaten and
                                enjoyed.
                                Either/or thinking also trips up people who believe that “if
                                I have more, then someone else will have less.” Again, this is
                                nothing more than fear-based, self-defeating programming.
                                The notion that the wealthy people of the world have and are
                                somehow hoarding all the money, so there’s none left for
                                anyone else, is preposterous. First, this belief assumes that
                                there is a limited supply of money. I’m not an economist, but
                                from what I can see, they just keep printing more of the stuff
                                every day. The actual money supply hasn’t been tied to any real
                                asset for decades. So even if the wealthy had all the money
                                today, tomorrow there’d be millions, if not billions, more
                                available.
                                The other thing people with this limited belief don’t seem to
                                realize is that the same money can be used over and over, to
                                create value for everyone. Let me give you an example I’ve
                                used in our seminars. I’ll ask five people to come onstage and
                                bring an item with them. I ask them to stand in a circle. Then I
                                give a $5 bill to the first person and ask them to buy
                                something from person number 2 for that money. Suppose
                                they buy a pen. So now person number 1 has a pen and person
                                number 2 has the $5. Person 2 now uses the same $5 bill to
                                buy, say, a clipboard from person number 3. Then number 3
                                uses the same $5 bill to buy a notebook from number
                                4. I hope you get the picture and the point. The exact same $5
                                was used to bring value to each person that had it. That same
                                $5 went through five different people and created $5 worth of
                                value for each and a total of $25 in value for the group. That
                                $5 did not get depleted and as it circled around, created value
                                for everyone.
                                136 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                The lessons are clear. First, money does not get depleted;
                                you can use the same money again and again for years and
                                years and thousands and thousands of people. Second, the
                                more money you have, the more you can put into the circle,
                                which means other people then have more money to trade for
                                more value.
                                This is exactly the opposite of either/or-based thinking. To
                                the contrary, when you have money and use it, you and the
                                person you spend it with both have the value. Put bluntly, if
                                you’re so worried about other people and making sure they get
                                their share (as if there is a share), do what it takes to get rich so
                                you can spread more money around.
                                If I can be an example for anything, it would be that you
                                can be a kind, loving, caring, generous, and spiritual person and
                                be really frickin’ rich. I strongly urge you to dispel the myth
                                that money is in any way bad or that you will be less “good” or
                                less “pure” if you are wealthy. That belief is absolute “salami”
                                (in case you’re tired of baloney), and if you keep eating it, you
                                won’t just be fat, you’ll be fat and broke. Hey, what do you
                                know, another example of both!
                                My friends, being kind, generous, and loving has nothing to
                                do with what is or isn’t in your wallet. Those attributes come
                                from what is in your heart. Being pure and spiritual have
                                nothing to do with what is or isn’t in your bank account; those
                                attributes come from what’s in your soul. To think money
                                makes you good or bad, one way or another, is either/or
                                thinking and just plain “programmed garbage” that is not
                                supportive to your happiness and success.
                                It’s also not supportive to those around you, especially to
                                children. If you’re that adamant about being a good person,
                                then be “good” enough not to infect the next generation

                                If you really want to live a life without limits, whatever the
                                situation, let go of either/or thinking and maintain the
                                intention to have “both.”

                                “I always think ‘both.’ ”
                                Touch your head and say...

                                1. Practice thinking and creating ways of having “both.”
                                Whenever alternatives are presented to you, ask yourself,
                                “How can I have both?”
                                2. Become aware that money in circulation adds to
                                everyone’s life. Each time you spend money, say to
                                yourself, “This money will go through hundreds of
                                people and create value for all of them.”
                                3. Think of yourself as a role model for others—showing
                                that you can be kind, generous, loving, and rich! </p>

                                tion “What is your net worth?” Few people talk this way, except of course at the country
                                club.
                                In country clubs, the financial discussion almost always
                                centers around net worth: “Jim just sold his stock options; he’s
                                worth over three million. Paul’s company just went public; he’s
                                worth eight million. Sue just sold her business; she’s now
                                worth twelve million.” At the country club, you’re not going to
                                hear, “Hey, did you hear that Joe got a raise? Yeah, and a two
                                percent cost-of-living allowance to boot?” If you did hear that,
                                you’d know you’re listening to a guest for the day.
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                The true measure of wealth is net worth,
                                not working income.
                                The true measure of wealth is net worth, not working income. Always has been, always
                                will be. Net worth is the financial value of everything you own. To determine your net
                                worth, add up the value of everything you own, including your
                                cash and investments such as stocks, bonds, real estate, the
                                current value of your business if you own one, the value of
                                your residence if you own it, and then subtract everything you
                                owe. Net worth is the ultimate measure of wealth because, if
                                necessary, what you own can eventually be liquidated into
                                cash.
                                Rich people understand the huge distinction between
                                working income and net worth. Working income is important,
                                but it is only one of the four factors that determine your net
                                worth. The four net worth factors are:
                                The Wealth Files - 139
                                1. Income
                                2. Savings
                                3. Investments
                                4. Simplification
                                Rich people understand that building a high net worth is an
                                equation that contains all four elements. Because all of these
                                factors are essential, let’s examine each one.
                                Income comes in two forms: working income and passive
                                income. Working income is the money earned from active
                                work. This includes a paycheck from a day-to-day job, or for
                                an entrepreneur, the profits or income taken from a business.
                                Working income requires that you are investing your own time
                                and labor to earn money. Working income is important
                                because, without it, it is almost impossible to address the other
                                three net worth factors.
                                Working income is how we fill up our financial “funnel,” so
                                to speak. All things being equal, the more working income you
                                earn, the more you can save and invest. Although working
                                income is critical, again it is only valuable as a part of the entire
                                net worth equation.
                                Unfortunately, poor and many middle-class people focus
                                exclusively on working income, out of the four factors. Consequently, they end up with a
                                low or no net worth.
                                Passive income is money earned without you actively
                                working. We will discuss passive income in greater detail a
                                little later, but for now, consider it another stream of income
                                filling up the funnel, which can then be used for spending,
                                saving, and investing.
                                Savings is also imperative. You can earn wads of money.
                                140 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                But if you don’t keep any of it, you will never create wealth.
                                Many people have a financial blueprint that is wired for
                                spending. Whatever money they have, they spend. They
                                choose immediate gratification over long-term balance.
                                Spenders have three mottoes. Their first motto is “It’s only
                                money.” Therefore, money is something they don’t have much
                                of. Their second motto is “What goes around, comes around.”
                                At least they hope so, because their third motto is “Sorry, I
                                can’t right now. I’m broke.” Without creating income to fill
                                the funnel and savings to keep it there, it is impossible to
                                address the next net worth factor.
                                Once you’ve begun saving a decent portion of your income,
                                then you can move to the next stage and make your money
                                grow through investing. Generally, the better you are at
                                investing, the faster your money will grow and generate a
                                greater net worth. Rich people take the time and energy to
                                learn about investing and investments. They pride themselves
                                on being excellent investors or at least hiring excellent
                                investors to invest for them. Poor people think investing is
                                only for rich people, so they never learn about it and stay
                                broke. Again, every part of the equation is important.
                                Our fourth net worth factor may well be the “dark horse”
                                of the bunch, because few people recognize its importance in
                                creating wealth. This is the factor of “simplification.” It goes
                                hand in hand with saving money, whereby you consciously
                                create a lifestyle in which you need less money to live on. By
                                decreasing your cost of living, you increase your savings and
                                the amount of funds available for investing.
                                To illustrate the power of simplification, here’s the story of
                                one of our Millionaire Mind participants. When Sue was only
                                twenty-three, she made a wise choice: she purchased a home.
                                She paid just under $300,000 at the time. Seven years
                                The Wealth Files - 141
                                later, in a sizzling hot market, Sue sold her home for over
                                $600,000, meaning she profited over $300,000. She considered
                                buying a new home, but after attending the Millionaire Mind
                                Intensive Seminar, she recognized that if she invested her
                                money in a secure second mortgage at 10 percent interest and
                                simplified her lifestyle, she could actually be quite comfortable
                                living on the earnings from her investments and not have to
                                work ever again. Instead of purchasing a new home, she
                                moved in with her sister. Now, at thirty years of age, Sue is
                                financially free. She won her independence not through
                                earning a ton of money, but by consciously scaling back her
                                personal overhead. Yes, she still works—because she enjoys
                                it—but she doesn’t have to. In fact, she only works six months
                                of the year. The rest of the time she spends in Fiji, first
                                because she loves it, and second, she says, her money goes
                                even further there. Because she lives with the locals rather than
                                the tourists, she doesn’t spend a lot. How many people do you
                                know who would love to spend six months of each year living
                                on a tropical island, never having to work again, at the ripe old
                                age of thirty? How about forty? Fifty? Sixty? Ever? It’s all
                                because Sue created a simple lifestyle and, consequently,
                                doesn’t need a fortune to live on.
                                So, what will it take for you to be happy financially? If you
                                need to live in a mansion, have three vacation homes, own ten
                                cars, take annual trips around the world, eat caviar, and drink
                                the finest champagne to enjoy your life, that’s fine, but
                                recognize you’ve set your bar pretty darn high, and it may take
                                you a long, long time to get to a point where you’re happy.
                                On the other hand, if you don’t need all the “toys” to be
                                happy, you’ll probably reach your financial goal a lot sooner.
                                Again, building your net worth is a four-part equation. As
                                142 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                an analogy, imagine driving a bus with four wheels. What
                                would the ride be like if you were driving on one wheel only?
                                Probably slow, bumpy, full of struggle, sparks, and going in
                                circles. Does that sound familiar? Rich people play the money
                                game on all four wheels. That’s why their ride is fast, smooth,
                                direct, and relatively easy.
                                By the way, I use the analogy of a bus because once you are
                                successful, your goal might be to bring others along on the
                                ride with you.
                                Poor and most middle-class people play the money game on
                                one wheel only. They believe that the only way to get rich is to
                                earn a lot of money. They believe that only because they’ve
                                never been there. They don’t understand Parkinson’s Law,
                                which states, “Expenses will always rise in direct proportion to
                                income.”
                                Here’s what’s normal in our society. You have a car, you
                                make more money, and you get a better car. You have a house,
                                you make more money, and you get a bigger house. You have
                                clothes, you make more money, and you get nicer clothes. You
                                have holidays, you make more money, and you spend more on
                                holidays. Of course there are a few exceptions to this
                                rule...very few! In general, as income goes up, expenses almost
                                invariably go up too. That’s why income alone will never
                                create wealth.
                                This book is called Secrets of the Millionaire Mind. Does
                                millionaire refer to income or net worth? Net worth. Therefore,
                                if your intention is to be a millionaire or more, you must focus
                                on building your net worth, which, as we’ve discussed, is based
                                on much more than just your income.
                                Make it a policy to know your net worth to the penny.
                                Here’s an exercise that can change your financial life forever.
                                Take a blank sheet of paper and title it “Net Worth.”
                                The Wealth Files - 143
                                Then create a simple chart that begins with zero and ends with
                                whatever your net worth objective is. Note your current net
                                worth as it is today. Then every ninety days, enter your new
                                net worth. That’s it. If you do this, you will find yourself
                                getting richer and richer. Why? Because you will be “tracking”
                                your net worth.
                                Remember: what you focus on expands. As I often say in
                                our training, “Where attention goes, energy flows and results
                                show.”
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                “Where attention goes, energy flows
                                and results show.”
                                By tracking your worth, you are focusing on it, and because
                                what you focus on expands, your net worth will expand. By
                                the way, this law goes for every other part of your life: what
                                you track increases.
                                To that end, I encourage you to find and work with a good
                                financial planner. These professionals can help you track and
                                build your net worth. They will assist you in organizing your
                                finances and introduce you to a variety of vehicles for saving
                                and growing your money.
                                The best way to find a good planner is to seek a referral
                                from a friend or associate who is happy with the person he or
                                she uses. I’m not saying to take everything your planner says as
                                gospel. But I am suggesting that you find a qualified
                                professional with the skills to help you plan and track your
                                finances. A good planner can provide you with the tools,
                                software, knowledge, and recommendations to help you build
                                the kind of investing habits that will produce wealth.
                                144 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                Generally, I recommend finding a planner who works with an
                                array of financial products rather than just insurance or just
                                mutual funds. In that way, you can find out about a variety of
                                options, then decide what’s right for you.
                                DECLARATION: Place your hand on your heart and say...
                                “I focus on building my net worth!”
                                Touch your head and say...
                                “I have a millionaire mind!”
                                MILLIONAIRE MIND ACTIONS
                                1. Focus on all four net worth factors: increasing your in
                                come, increasing your savings, increasing your investment
                                returns, and decreasing your cost of living by simplifying
                                your lifestyle.
                                2. Create a net worth statement. To do this, add the current
                                dollar value of everything you own (your assets) and
                                subtract the total value of everything you owe (your
                                liabilities). Commit to tracking and revising this statement
                                each quarter. Again, by virtue of the law of focus, what
                                you track will increase.
                                3. Hire a financial planner who is highly successful and
                                works with a well-known, reputable company. Again, the
                                best way to find a great financial planner is to ask friends
                                and associates for their referrals. </p>

                            <p>Thomas Stanley, in his best-selling book, The Millionaire Next
                                Door, surveyed millionaires from across North America and
                                reported on who they are and how they attained their wealth.
                                The results can be summarized in one short sentence: “Rich
                                people are good at managing their money.” Rich people
                                manage their money well. Poor people mismanage their
                                money.
                                Wealthy people are not any smarter than poor people; they
                                just have different and more supportive money habits. As we
                                discussed in Part I of this book, these habits are primarily
                                based on our past conditioning. So first, if you’re not
                                managing your money properly, you were probably programmed not to manage money. Second,
                                there’s a better than
                                good chance you don’t know how to manage your money in a
                                way that’s easy and effective. I don’t know about you, but
                                where I went to school, Money Management 101 wasn’t
                                offered. Instead we learned about the War of 1812, which of
                                course is something I use every single day.
                                It may not be the most glamorous of topics, but it comes
                                down to this: the single biggest difference between financial
                                success and financial failure is how well you manage your
                                money. It’s simple: to master money, you must manage
                                money.
                                Poor people either mismanage their money or they avoid
                                the subject of money altogether. Many people don’t like to
                                manage their money because, first, they say it restricts their
                                146 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                freedom, and second, they say they don’t have enough money
                                to manage.
                                As for the first excuse, managing money does not restrict
                                your freedom—to the contrary, it promotes it. Managing your
                                money allows you to eventually create financial freedom so
                                that you never have to work again. To me, that’s real freedom.
                                As for those who use the “I don’t have enough money to
                                manage” rationale, they’re looking through the wrong end of
                                the telescope. Rather than say “when I have plenty of money,
                                I’ll begin to manage it,” the reality is “when I begin to manage
                                it, I’ll have plenty of money.”
                                Saying “I’ll start managing my money as soon as I get
                                caught up” is like an overweight person saying “I’ll start exercising and dieting as
                                soon as I lose twenty pounds.” It’s
                                putting the cart before the horse, which leads to going
                                nowhere...or even backward! First you start properly handling
                                the money you have, then you’ll have more money to handle.
                                In the Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar, I tell a story that
                                hits most people right between the eyes. Imagine you’re
                                walking along the street with a five-year-old. You come across
                                an ice cream store and go inside. You get the child a single
                                scoop of ice cream on a cone because they don’t have any
                                cups. As the two of you walk outside, you notice the cone
                                wobbling in the child’s tiny hands and, all of a sudden, plop.
                                The ice cream falls out of the cone onto the pavement.
                                The child begins to cry. So back you go into the store, and
                                just as you’re about to order for the second time, the child
                                notices a colorful sign with a picture of the “triple scooper”
                                cone. The child points to the picture and excitedly screams, “I
                                want that one!”
                                The Wealth Files - 147
                                Now here’s the question. Being the kind, loving, and
                                generous person that you are, would you go ahead and get this
                                child the triple scooper? Your initial response might be “sure.”
                                However, when considering the question a little more deeply,
                                most of our seminar participants respond, “No.” Because why
                                would you want to set the child up to fail? The child couldn’t
                                even handle a single scoop, how could the child possibly
                                handle a triple scoop?
                                The same holds true when it comes to the universe and you.
                                We live in a kind and loving universe, and the rule is “Until
                                you show you can handle what you’ve got, you won’t get any
                                more!”

                                Until you show you can handle what you’ve got,
                                you won’t get any more!
                                You must acquire the habits and skills of managing a small
                                amount of money before you can have a large amount.
                                Remember, we are creatures of habit, and therefore the habit
                                of managing your money is more important than the amount.

                                agement method. It’s beyond the scope of this book to go
                                over every detail; however, let me give you a couple of the
                                basics so you can get started.
                                Open a separate bank account designated your Financial
                                Freedom Account. Put 10 percent of every dollar you receive
                                (after taxes) into this fund. This money is only to be used for
                                investments and buying or creating passive-income streams.
                                The job of this account is to build a golden goose that lays
                                golden eggs called passive income. And when do you get to
                                spend this money? Never! It is never spent—only invested.
                                Eventually, when you retire, you get to spend the income from
                                the fund (the eggs), but never the principal itself. In this way, it
                                always keeps growing and you can never go broke.
                                One of our students, named Emma, recently told me her
                                story. Two years ago Emma was about to claim bankruptcy.
                                She didn’t want to; however, she felt she had no other option.
                                She was in debt beyond what she could handle. Then she
                                attended the Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar and learned
                                about the money management system. Emma said, “This is it.
                                This is how I’m going to get out of this mess!”
                                Emma, like all the participants, was told to divide her
                                money into several different accounts. “That’s just great,” she
                                thought to herself. “I don’t have any money to divide up!” But
                                since she wanted to try, Emma decided to divide up $1 a
                                month into the accounts. Yes, that’s right, only $1 a month.
                                Based on the allocation system we teach, using that one
                                dollar, she put ten cents into her FFA (Financial Freedom
                                Account). The first thing she thought to herself was “How the
                                heck am I supposed to become financially free on ten cents a
                                month?” So she committed to doubling that dollar every
                                month. The second month she divided up $2, the
                                The Wealth Files - 149
                                third month $4, then $8, $16, $32, $64, and so on until the
                                twelfth month was $2,048 that she was dividing up each
                                month.
                                Then, two years later, she began to collect some amazing
                                fruits from her efforts. She was able to put $10,000 directly
                                into her Financial Freedom Account! She had developed the
                                habit of managing her money so well that, when a bonus check
                                of $10,000 came her way, she didn’t need the money for
                                anything else!
                                Emma is now out of debt and on her way to becoming financially free. All because she
                                took action with what she’d
                                learned, even if it was only with $1 a month.
                                It doesn’t matter if you have a fortune right now or virtually
                                nothing. What does matter is that you immediately begin to
                                manage what you’ve got, and you’ll be in shock at how soon
                                you get more.
                                I had another student at the Millionaire Mind Intensive
                                Seminar say, “How can I manage my money when I’m borrowing money to live on as it is?”
                                The answer is, borrow an
                                extra dollar and manage that dollar. Even if you are borrowing
                                or finding just a few dollars a month, you must manage that
                                money, because more than a “physical” world principle is at
                                play here: this is also a spiritual principle. Money miracles will
                                occur once you demonstrate to the universe that you can
                                handle your finances properly.
                                In addition to opening a Financial Freedom bank account,
                                create a Financial Freedom jar in your home and deposit
                                money into it every day. It could be $10, $5, $1, a single penny,
                                or all your loose change. The amount doesn’t matter; the habit
                                does. The secret again is to place daily “attention” on your
                                objective of becoming financially free. Like attracts like,
                                money attracts more money. Let this simple jar

                                money and opportunities for financial freedom into your life.
                                Now, I’m sure this isn’t the first time you’ve heard the advice to save 10 percent of
                                your money for long-term investing,
                                but it may be the first time you’ve heard that you must have an
                                equal and opposite account specifically designed for you to
                                “blow” money and play.
                                One of the biggest secrets to managing money is balance.
                                On one side, you want to save as much money as possible so
                                you can invest it and make more money. On the other side,
                                you need to put another 10 percent of your income into a
                                “play” account. Why? Because we are holistic in nature. You
                                cannot affect one part of your life without affecting the others.
                                Some people save, save, save, and while their logical and
                                responsible self is fulfilled, their “inner spirit” is not. Eventually this
                                “fun-seeking” spirit side will say, “I’ve had enough. I
                                want some attention too,” and sabotage their results.
                                On the other hand, if you spend, spend, spend, not only will
                                you never become rich, but the responsible part of you will
                                eventually create the situation where you don’t even enjoy the
                                things you spend your money on, and you’ll end up feeling
                                guilty. The guilt will then cause you to unconsciously
                                overspend as a way of expressing your emotions. Although
                                you might feel better temporarily, soon it’s back to guilt and
                                shame. It’s a vicious cycle, and the only way to prevent it is to
                                learn how to manage your money in a way that works.
                                Your play account is primarily used to nurture yourself— to
                                do the things you wouldn’t normally do. It’s for the extraspecial things like going to a
                                restaurant and ordering a bottle
                                of their finest wine or champagne. Or renting a boat
                                The Wealth Files - 151
                                for the day. Or staying in a high-class hotel for an extravagant
                                night of fun and frolic.
                                The play account rule is that it must be spent every month.
                                That’s right! Each month you have to blow all the money in
                                that account in a way that makes you feel rich. For example,
                                imagine walking into a massage center, dumping all the money
                                from your account on the counter, pointing to the massage
                                therapists, and saying, “I want both of you on me. With the hot
                                rocks and the frickin’ cucumbers. After that, bring me lunch!”
                                Like I said, extravagant. The only way most of us will ever
                                continue to follow our saving plan is by offsetting it with a
                                playing plan that will reward us for our efforts. Your play account is also designed to
                                strengthen your “receiving” muscle.
                                It also makes managing money a heck of a lot more fun. In
                                addition to the play account and the financial freedom account, I advise that you create
                                four more accounts. The other
                                accounts include:
                                10 percent into your Long-Term Savings for Spending
                                Account
                                10 percent into your Education Account
                                50 percent into your Necessities Account
                                10 percent into your Give Account
                                Again, poor people think it’s all about income; they believe
                                you have to earn a fortune to get rich. Again, that’s male-cow
                                manure! The fact is that if you manage your money following
                                this program, you can become financially free on a relatively
                                small income. If you mismanage your money, you can’t
                                become financially free, even on a huge in

                                come. That is why so many high-income professionals—
                                doctors, lawyers, athletes, and even accountants—are basically
                                broke, because it’s not just about what comes in, it’s about
                                what you do with what comes in.
                                One of our attendees, John, told me that when he first
                                heard about the money management system, he thought,
                                “How boring! Why would anyone spend their precious time
                                doing that?” Then later during the seminar he finally realized if
                                he wanted to be financially free someday, especially sooner
                                than later, he too would have to manage his money, just like
                                the rich.
                                John had to learn this new habit because it definitely wasn’t
                                natural for him. He said it reminded him of when he was
                                training for triathlons. He was really good at swimming and
                                cycling; however, he hated the running. It hurt his feet, knees,
                                and back. He was stiff after every training session. He was
                                always out of breath and his lungs burned every time, even if
                                he wasn’t going fast! He used to dread running. However, he
                                knew that if he was to become a top triathlete, he had to learn
                                to run and accept it as part of what it took to succeed.
                                Whereas in the past John avoided running, he now decided to
                                run every day. After a few months, he began enjoying running
                                and actually looked forward to it each day.
                                This is exactly what happened to John in the arena of
                                money management. He started out hating every minute of it
                                but grew to actually like it. Now he looks forward to getting
                                his paycheck and dividing it into the different accounts! He
                                also enjoys watching how his net worth has gone from zero to
                                over $300,000 and is growing daily.
                                It comes down to this: either you control money, or it will
                                control you. To control money, you must manage it.

                                I love hearing seminar graduates share how much more
                                confident they feel around money, success, and themselves
                                once they begin managing their money properly. The best part
                                is that this confidence transfers into other parts of their lives
                                and enhances their happiness, their relationships, and even
                                their health.
                                Money is a big part of your life, and when you learn how to
                                get your finances under control, all areas of your life will soar.

                                1. Open your Financial Freedom bank account. Put 10
                                percent of all your income (after taxes) into this account.
                                This money is never to be spent, only invested to produce
                                passive income for your retirement.
                                2. Create a Financial Freedom jar in your home and deposit
                                money into it every day. It could be $10, $5, $1, a single

                                attention on your financial freedom, and where attention

                                To: T. Harv Eker
                                To put it simply, after attending T. Harv Eker’s Millionaire
                                Mind Intensive, my relationship with money completely
                                changed, and my business grew by 400 percent within one
                                year.
                                Most importantly, my husband and I finally “got” how
                                important it was to save the first 10 percent of our income
                                every month, no matter what. Now, I’m happy to say, we’ve
                                saved more in the few years after attending Harv’s program
                                than we had in the previous fifteen years!
                                Plus, the techniques we learned for solving money issues
                                in our relationship has kept us “money argument” free ever
                                since.
                                Harv’s money management system is easy to follow and
                                works!

                                not wait another day. Even if you only have a dollar.
                                Manage that dollar. Take ten cents and put it into your
                                FFA jar, and another ten cents and put it into your play
                                jar. This action alone will send a message to the

                                that you “have to work hard for money.” Chances are good,
                                however, that you didn’t grow up with the conditioning that it
                                was just as important to make your money “work hard for

                                lounging around the country clubs of the world? Who spends
                                their afternoons playing golf, tennis, or sailing? Who spends
                                their days shopping and their weeks vacationing? I’ll give you
                                three guesses and the first two don’t count.

                                Rich people, that’s who! So let’s get this straight: the idea that
                                you have to work hard to get rich is bogus!
                                The old Protestant work ethic states “a dollar’s work for a
                                dollar’s pay.” There’s nothing wrong with that adage except
                                that they forgot to tell us what to do with that “dollar’s pay.”
                                Knowing what to do with that dollar is where you move from
                                hard work to smart work.
                                Rich people can spend their days playing and relaxing because they work smart. They
                                understand and use leverage.

                                to work for them.
                                Yes, in my experience, you do have to work hard for your
                                money. For rich people, however, this is a temporary situation.
                                For poor people, it’s permanent. Rich people understand that
                                “you” have to work hard until your “money” works hard
                                enough to take your place. They understand that the more your
                                money works, the less you will have to work.
                                Remember, money is energy. Most people put work energy
                                in and get money energy out. People who achieve financial
                                freedom have learned how to substitute their investment of
                                work energy with other forms of energy. These forms include
                                other people’s work, business systems at work, or investment
                                capital at work. Again, first you work hard for money, then
                                you let money work hard for you.
                                When it comes to the money game, most people don’t have
                                a clue as to what it takes to win. What’s your goal? When do
                                you win the game? Are you shooting for three square meals a
                                day, $100,000 a year in income, becoming a millionaire,
                                becoming a multimillionaire? At the Millionaire Mind Intensive
                                Seminar, the goal of the money game we teach is to “never
                                have to work again... unless you choose
                                The Wealth Files - 157
                                to,” and that if you work, you work “by choice, not by necessity.”
                                In other words, the goal is to become “financially free” as
                                quickly as possible. My definition of financial freedom is
                                simple: it is the ability to live the lifestyle you desire without having to
                                work or rely on anyone else for money.
                                Notice there is a good chance that your desired lifestyle is
                                going to cost money. Therefore, to be “free,” you will need to
                                earn money without working. We refer to income without
                                work as passive income. To win the money game, the goal is
                                to earn enough passive income to pay for your desired lifestyle.
                                In short, you become financially free when your passive
                                income exceeds your expenses.
                                I have identified two primary sources of passive income.
                                The first is “money working for you.” This includes investment earnings from financial
                                instruments such as stocks,
                                bonds, T-bills, money markets, mutual funds, as well as
                                owning mortgages or other assets that appreciate in value and
                                can be liquidated for cash.
                                The second major source of passive income is “business
                                working for you.” This entails generating ongoing income
                                from businesses where you do not need to be personally
                                involved for that business to operate and yield an income.
                                Examples include rental real estate; royalties from books,
                                music, or software; licensing your ideas; becoming a franchisor; owning storage units;
                                owning vending or other types of
                                coin-operated machines; and network marketing, to name just
                                a few. It also includes setting up any business under the sun or
                                moon that is systematized to work without you. Again, it’s a
                                matter of energy. The idea is that the business is working and
                                producing value for people, instead of you.

                                Network marketing, for example, is an amazing concept.
                                First, it doesn’t usually require you to put up a lot of up-front
                                capital. Second, once you’ve done the initial work, it allows
                                you to enjoy ongoing residual income (another form of
                                income without you working), year after year after year. Try
                                creating that from a regular nine-to-five job!
                                I can’t overemphasize the importance of creating passive
                                income structures. It’s simple. Without passive income you can
                                never be free. But, and it’s a big but, did you know that most
                                people have a tough time creating passive income? There are
                                three reasons. First, conditioning. Most of us were actually
                                programmed not to earn passive income. When you were
                                somewhere between thirteen and sixteen years old and you
                                needed money, what did your parents tell you? Did they say,
                                “Well, go out there and earn some passive income?” Doubtful!
                                Most of us heard, “Go to work,” “Go get a job,” or something
                                to that effect. We were taught to “work” for money, making
                                passive income abnormal for most of us.
                                Second, most of us were never taught how to earn passive
                                income.
                                In my school, Passive Income 101 was another subject that
                                was never offered. This time I got to take woodworking and
                                metalworking (notice both still entailed “working”) and make
                                the perfect candleholder for my mom. Since we didn’t learn
                                about creating passive income structures in school, we learned
                                it elsewhere, right? Doubtful. The end result is that most of us
                                don’t know much about it, and therefore don’t do much about
                                it.
                                Finally, since we were never exposed to or taught about
                                passive income and investing, we have never given it much
                                attention. We have largely based our career and business
                                choices on generating working income. If you understood
                                The Wealth Files - 159
                                from an early age that a primary financial goal was to create
                                passive income, wouldn’t you reconsider some of those career
                                choices?
                                I’m always recommending to folks choosing or changing
                                their business or career to find a direction where generating
                                streams of passive income is natural and relatively easy. This is
                                especially important today because so many people work in
                                service businesses where they have to be there personally to
                                make money. There’s nothing wrong with being in a personal
                                service business, other than that unless you get on your
                                investment horse pretty soon and do exceptionally well, you’ll
                                be trapped into working forever.
                                By choosing business opportunities that immediately or
                                eventually produce passive income, you’ll have the best of
                                both worlds—working income now and passive income later.
                                Refer back a few paragraphs to review some of the passive
                                business income options we discussed.
                                Unfortunately, almost everyone has a money blueprint that
                                is set for earning working income and against earning passive
                                income. This attitude will be radically changed after you attend
                                the Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar, where using
                                experiential techniques, we change your money blueprint so
                                that earning a massive passive income is normal and natural
                                for you.
                                Rich people think long-term. They balance their spending
                                on enjoyment today with investing for freedom tomorrow.
                                Poor people think short-term. They run their lives based on
                                immediate gratification. Poor people use the excuse “How can
                                I think about tomorrow when I can barely survive today?” The
                                problem is that, eventually, tomorrow will become today; if
                                you haven’t taken care of today’s problem, you’ll be saying the
                                same thing again tomorrow too.

                                To increase your wealth, you either have to earn more or
                                live on less. I don’t see anyone putting a gun to your head
                                telling you the house you have to live in, the kind of car you
                                have to drive, the clothes you have to wear, or the food you
                                have to eat. You have the power to make choices. It’s a matter
                                of priorities. Poor people choose now, rich people choose
                                balance. I think about my in-laws.
                                For twenty-five years my wife’s parents owned a variety
                                store, a low-end version of a 7-Eleven and a lot smaller. Most
                                of their income came from the sale of cigarettes, candy bars,
                                ice cream bars, gum, and sodas. They didn’t even sell lottery
                                tickets in those days. The average sale was less than a dollar. In
                                short, they were in a “penny” business. Still, they saved most
                                of those pennies. The didn’t eat out; they didn’t buy fancy
                                clothes; they didn’t drive the latest car. They lived comfortably
                                but modestly and eventually paid off their mortgage and even
                                bought half of the plaza the store was located within. At the
                                age of fifty-nine, by saving and investing “pen-nies,”my fatherin-law was able to
                                retire.
                                I hate to be the one to have to tell you this, but for the most
                                part, buying things for immediate gratification is nothing more
                                than a futile attempt to make up for our dissatisfaction in life.
                                More often than not, “spending” money you don’t have comes
                                from “expending” emotions you do have. This syndrome is
                                commonly known as retail therapy. Overspending and the
                                need for immediate gratification have little to do with the
                                actual item you’re buying, and everything to do with lack of
                                fulfillment in your life. Of course, if overspending isn’t coming
                                from your immediate emotions, it arises from your money
                                blueprint.
                                According to Natalie, another of our students, her parents
                                were the ultimate cheapskates! They used coupons for every
                                The Wealth Files - 161
                                thing. Her mother had a file box full of coupons all sorted by
                                category. Her father had a fifteen-year-old car that was rusting,
                                and Natalie was embarrassed to be seen in it, especially when
                                her mom picked her up from school. Anytime she got in the
                                car, Natalie prayed that no one was looking. On vacation, her
                                family never stayed in a motel or hotel; they didn’t even fly,
                                but drove eleven days across the country and camped the
                                whole way, every year!
                                Everything was “too expensive.” The way they acted, Natalie thought her parents were
                                broke. But her dad earned what
                                she believed was a lot of money at the time, $75,000 a year.
                                She was confused.
                                Because she hated their stingy habits, she became the opposite. She wanted everything to
                                be high-class and expensive.
                                When she moved out on her own and started making her own
                                money, she didn’t even realize it, but in a flash, she had spent
                                all the money she had, and then some!
                                Natalie had credit cards, membership cards, you name it.
                                She racked up all of them to the point where she couldn’t even
                                pay the minimums anymore! That’s when she took the
                                Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar, and she says it saved her
                                life.
                                At the Millionaire Mind Intensive, during the section where
                                we identify your “money personality,” Natalie’s whole world
                                changed. She recognized why she had been spending all her
                                money. It was a form of resentment toward her parents for
                                being so cheap. It was also to prove to herself and the world
                                that she wasn’t cheap. Since the course, with her blueprint
                                changed, Natalie says she no longer has the urge to spend her
                                money in “stupid” ways.
                                Natalie related she was recently walking through a mall and
                                noticed this gorgeous light brown suede and fur coat
                                162 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                hanging in the window display of one of her favorite stores.
                                Immediately her mind said, “That coat would look great on
                                you, especially with your blond hair. You need that; you don’t
                                have a really nice, dressy winter coat.” So she walked into the
                                store, and as she was trying it on, she noticed the price tag,
                                $400. She had never spent that much on a coat before. Her
                                mind said, “So what, the coat looks gorgeous on you! Get it.
                                You’ll make the money up later.”
                                This is where she says she discovered how profound the
                                Millionaire Mind Intensive is. Almost as soon as her mind
                                suggested that she buy the coat, her new and more supportive
                                mind “file” came up and said, “You’d be much better off
                                putting that four hundred dollars toward your FFA account!
                                What do you need this coat for? You already have a winter
                                coat that’s okay for now.”
                                Before she knew it, she was putting the coat on hold until
                                the next day instead of buying it right there in the moment as
                                usual. She never went back to get the coat.
                                Natalie realized that her mental “material gratification” files
                                had been replaced with “financial freedom” files. She wasn’t
                                programmed to spend anymore. She now knows it’s fine to
                                take the best of what her parents modeled for her and save
                                money, and at the same time, to treat herself to nice things
                                with her play account.
                                Natalie then sent her parents to the course so they could be
                                more balanced as well. She’s thrilled to report, they now stay in
                                motels (not hotels yet), they bought a new car, and in learning
                                how to make their money work for them, they’ve retired as
                                millionaires.
                                Natalie now understands that she doesn’t have to be as
                                “cheap” as her parents were to become a millionaire. But she
                                The Wealth Files - 163
                                also knows that if she spends her money unconsciously as
                                before, she’ll never be financially free. Natalie said, “It feels
                                amazing to have my money and my mind under control.”
                                Again, the idea is to have your money work as hard for you
                                as you do for it, and that means you have to save and invest
                                rather than make it your mission in life to spend it all. It’s
                                almost funny: rich people have a lot of money and spend a
                                little, while poor people have a little money and spend a lot.
                                Long-term versus short-term: poor people work to earn
                                money to live today; rich people work to earn money to pay
                                for their investments, which will pay for their future.
                                Rich people buy assets, things that will likely go up in value.
                                Poor people buy expenses, things that will definitely go down
                                in value. Rich people collect land. Poor people collect bills.
                                I’ll tell you the same thing I tell my kids: “Buy real estate.”
                                It’s best if you can purchase property that can produce positive
                                cash flow, but as far as I’m concerned, any real estate is better
                                than no real estate. Sure, real estate has its ups and downs, but
                                in the end, be it five, ten, twenty, or thirty years from now, you
                                can bet it will be worth a heck of a lot more than it is today,
                                and it could be all you need to get rich.
                                Buy what you can afford now. If you need more capital to
                                get involved, you can partner with people you trust and know
                                well. The only way to get in trouble with real estate is to
                                overextend yourself or have to sell in a down market. If you
                                heed my earlier advice and manage your money properly, the
                                likelihood of this happening will be extremely slim and likely
                                none. As the saying goes, “Don’t wait to buy real estate, buy
                                real estate and wait.”
                                164 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                Since I gave you a previous example involving my in-laws,
                                it’s only fair I give you an example involving my own parents.
                                My parents weren’t poor, but they barely made the middle
                                class. My dad worked extremely hard and my mom wasn’t
                                physically well, and so she stayed home with us kids. My dad
                                was a carpenter and recognized that all the builders who
                                employed him were developing land they had purchased years
                                and years ago. He also recognized they were all fairly rich. My
                                parents too saved their pennies and eventually had enough to
                                buy a three-acre parcel of land about twenty miles outside the
                                city in which they lived. It cost them $60,000. Ten years later, a
                                developer decided he wanted to build a strip mall on that
                                property. My parents sold for $600,000. Less their original
                                investment, that’s an average earnings of $54,000 a year from
                                their investment, while my dad earned only about $15,000 to a
                                high of $20,000 a year from his job. Of course they are retired
                                now and live quite comfortably, but I guarantee that without
                                the purchase and sale of this property, they would have been
                                living by the skin of their teeth. Thank goodness my father
                                recognized the power of investment and especially the value of
                                investing in real estate. Now you know why I collect land.
                                While poor people see a dollar as a dollar to trade for
                                something they want right now, rich people see every dollar as
                                a “seed” that can be planted to earn a hundred more dollars,
                                which can then be replanted to earn a thousand more dollars.
                                Think about it. Every dollar you spend today may actually cost
                                you a hundred dollars tomorrow. Personally, I consider each
                                of my dollars to be investment “soldiers,” and their mission is
                                “freedom.” Needless to say, I’m careful with my “freedom
                                fighters” and don’t get rid of them quickly or easily.

                                Rich people see every dollar as a “seed”
                                that can be planted to earn a hundred

                                The trick is to get educated. Learn about the investment
                                world. Become familiar with a variety of different investment
                                vehicles and financial instruments, such as real estate,
                                mortgages, stocks, funds, bonds, currency exchange, the whole
                                gamut. Then choose one primary area in which to become an
                                expert. Begin investing in that area and then diversify into
                                more, later.
                                It comes down to this: poor people work hard and spend all
                                their money, which results in their having to work hard
                                forever. Rich people work hard, save, and then invest their
                                money so they never have to work hard again.

                                affirmations, visualizations,
                                and meditations for getting rich. I meditate almost every day.
                                Yet I’ve never sat there meditating or visualizing and had a bag
                                of money drop on my head. I guess I’m just one of those
                                unfortunate ones who actually has to do something to be a
                                success.
                                Affirmations, meditations, and visualizations are all wonderful tools, but as far as I
                                can tell, none of them on its own is
                                going to bring you real money in the real world. In the real
                                world, you have to take real “action” to succeed. Why is action
                                so critical?
                                Let’s go back to our Process of Manifestation. Look at

                                thoughts and feelings. Are they part of the inner world or
                                outer world? Inner world. Now look at results. Are they
                                part of the inner or outer world? Outer world. That means
                                action is the “bridge” between the inner world and the outer
                                world.

                                Action is the “bridge” between the inner world
                                and the outer world.
                                So if action is so important, what prevents us from taking
                                the actions we know we need to take?
                                Fear!
                                Fear, doubt, and worry are among the greatest obstacles,
                                not only to success, but to happiness as well. Therefore, one of
                                the biggest differences between rich people and poor people is
                                that rich people are willing to act in spite of fear. Poor people
                                let fear stop them.
                                Susan Jeffers even wrote a fantastic book about this, entitled Feel the Fear and Do It
                                Anyway. The biggest mistake most
                                people make is waiting for the feeling of fear to subside or
                                disappear before they are willing to act. These people usually
                                wait forever.
                                One of our most popular programs is the Enlightened
                                Warrior Training Camp. In that training, we teach that a true
                                warrior can “tame the cobra of fear.” It doesn’t say kill the
                                cobra. It doesn’t say get rid of the cobra, and it certainly
                                doesn’t say run away from the cobra. It says “tame” the cobra.

                                It’s imperative to realize that it is not necessary to try to get
                                rid of fear in order to succeed. Rich and successful people
                                have fear, rich and successful people have doubts, rich and
                                successful people have worries. They just don’t let these
                                feelings stop them. Unsuccessful people have fears, doubts,
                                and worries, then let those feelings stop them.
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                It is not necessary to try to get rid of fear
                                in order to succeed.
                                Because we are creatures of habit, we need to practice acting in spite of fear, in spite
                                of doubt, in spite of worry, in spite
                                of uncertainty, in spite of inconvenience, in spite of
                                discomfort, and even to practice acting when we’re not in the
                                mood to act.
                                I remember teaching an evening seminar in Seattle, and near
                                the end, I was letting people know about the upcoming threeday Millionaire Mind
                                Intensive Seminar being held in
                                Vancouver. This one fella stands up and says, “Harv, I’ve had
                                at least a dozen of my family and friends attend the course,
                                and the results have been absolutely phenomenal. Every one
                                of them is ten times happier than before, and they’re all on the
                                road to financial success. They all said it was life changing, and
                                if you were holding the course in Seattle, I’d definitely come
                                too.”
                                I thanked him for his testimonial and then asked if he was
                                open to some coaching. He agreed and I said, “I have only
                                three words for you.” He cheerfully replied, “What are they?”
                                To which I tersely responded, “You’re frickin’ broke!”
                                Then I asked him how he was doing financially. He
                                The Wealth Files - 169
                                sheepishly replied, “Not too good.” Of course I replied, “No
                                kidding.” I then began ranting and raving at the front of the
                                room: “If you are going to let a three-hour drive or a threehour flight or a three-day
                                trek stop you from doing something
                                you need and want to do, then what else will stop you? Here’s
                                the easy answer: anything! Anything will stop you. Not because
                                of the size of the challenge but because of the size of you!
                                “It’s simple,” I continued. “Either you are a person who will
                                be stopped, or you are a person who won’t be stopped. You
                                choose. If you want to create wealth or any other kind of
                                success, you have to be a warrior. You have to be willing to do
                                whatever it takes. You have to ‘train’ yourself to not be stopped by
                                anything.
                                “Getting rich is not always convenient. Getting rich is not
                                always easy. In fact, getting rich can be pretty damn hard. But
                                so what? One of the key enlightened warrior principles states,
                                ‘If you are willing to do only what’s easy, life will be hard. But
                                if you are willing to do what’s hard, life will be easy.’ Rich
                                people don’t base their actions on what’s easy and convenient;
                                that way of living is reserved for the poor and most of the
                                middle class.”
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                If you are willing to do only what’s easy,
                                life will be hard. But if you are willing to do
                                what’s hard, life will be easy.
                                The tirade was over. The crowd was silent.
                                Later, the fella who’d started the entire discussion came up
                                and thanked me profusely for “opening his eyes.” Of

                                course he registered for the course (even though it was in
                                Vancouver), but what was really funny was overhearing him
                                on the phone as I was leaving, fervently giving the exact same
                                speech I had just given him to one of his friends on the other
                                end of the line. I guess it worked because the next day he
                                called in with three more registrations. They were all from the
                                East Coast... and they were all coming to Vancouver!
                                Now that we’ve addressed convenience, what about discomfort? Why is acting in spite of
                                discomfort so important?
                                Because “comfortable” is where you’re at now. If you want to
                                move to a new level in your life, you must break through your
                                comfort zone and practice doing things that are not
                                comfortable.
                                Let’s suppose you are currently leading a level 5 life and you
                                want to move to a level 10 life. Level 5 and below are within
                                your comfort zone, but level 6 and above are outside your box,
                                in your “uncomfort” zone. Meaning, to get to a level 10 life
                                from a level 5 life, you will have to travel through your
                                uncomfort zone.
                                Poor people and most of the middle class are not willing to
                                be uncomfortable. Remember, being comfortable is their
                                biggest priority in life. But let me tell you a secret that only rich
                                and highly successful people know: being comfortable is highly
                                overrated. Being comfortable may make you feel warm, fuzzy,
                                and secure, but it doesn’t allow you to grow. To grow as a
                                person you have to expand your comfort zone. The only time
                                you can actually grow is when you are outside your comfort
                                zone.
                                Let me ask you a question. The first time you tried something new, was it comfortable or
                                uncomfortable? Usually
                                uncomfortable. But what happened afterward? The more
                                The Wealth Files - 171
                                you did it, the more comfortable it became, right? That’s how
                                it goes. Everything is uncomfortable at the beginning, but if
                                you stick with it and continue, you will eventually move
                                through the uncomfort zone and succeed. Then you will have
                                a new, expanded comfort zone, which means you will have
                                become a “bigger” person.
                                Again, the only time you are actually growing is when you
                                are uncomfortable. From now on, whenever you feel uncomfortable, instead of retreating
                                back into your old comfort
                                zone, pat yourself on the back and say, “I must be growing,”
                                and continue moving forward.
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                The only time you are actually growing
                                is when you are uncomfortable.
                                If you want to be rich and successful, you’d better get
                                comfortable with being uncomfortable. Consciously practice
                                going into your uncomfort zone and doing what scares you.
                                Here’s an equation I want you to remember for the rest of
                                your life: CZ = WZ.
                                It means your “comfort zone” equals your “wealth zone.”
                                By expanding your comfort zone, you will expand the size
                                of your income and wealth zone. The more comfortable you
                                have to be, the fewer risks you will be willing to take, the fewer
                                opportunities you will take advantage of, the fewer people you
                                will meet, and the fewer new strategies you will try. Do you
                                catch my drift? The more comfort becomes your priority, the
                                more contracted you become with fear.
                                On the contrary, when you are willing to s-t-r-e-t-c-h
                                yourself, you expand your opportunity zone, and this allows
                                172 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                you to attract and hold more income and wealth. Again, when
                                you have a large “container” (comfort zone), the universe will
                                rush to fill the space. Rich and successful people have a big
                                comfort zone, and they are constantly expanding it to be able
                                to attain and hold more wealth.
                                Nobody ever died of discomfort, yet living in the name of
                                comfort has killed more ideas, more opportunities, more actions, and more growth than
                                everything else combined.
                                Comfort kills! If your goal in life is to be comfortable, I
                                guarantee two things. First, you will never be rich. Second, you
                                will never be happy. Happiness doesn’t come from living a
                                lukewarm life, always wondering what could have been.
                                Happiness comes as a result of being in our natural state of
                                growth and living up to our fullest potential.
                                Try this. The next time you are feeling uncomfortable,
                                uncertain, or afraid, instead of shrinking and retreating back to
                                safety, press forward. Notice and experience the feelings of
                                discomfort, recognizing that they are only feelings—and that
                                they do not have the power to stop you. If you doggedly
                                continue in spite of discomfort, you will eventually reach your
                                goal.
                                Whether the feelings of discomfort ever subside doesn’t
                                matter. In fact, when they do lessen, take it as a sign to increase your objective,
                                because the minute you get comfortable,
                                you have stopped growing. Again, to grow yourself to your
                                fullest potential, you must always be living at the edge of your
                                box.
                                And because we are creatures of habit, we must practice. I
                                urge you to practice acting in spite of fear, practice acting in
                                spite of inconvenience, practice acting in spite of discomfort,
                                and practice acting even when you’re not in the mood.

                                By doing so, you will quickly move to a higher level of life.
                                Along the way, make sure you check your bank account, because, guaranteed, that will be
                                growing quickly too.
                                At this point in some of my evening seminars I ask the audience, “How many of you are
                                willing to practice acting in
                                spite of fear and discomfort?” Usually everyone puts his or her
                                hand up (probably because they’re scared to death I’m going
                                to “pick” on them). Then I say, “Talk is cheap! Let’s see
                                whether you mean it.” I then pull out a wooden arrow with a
                                steel-pointed tip and explain that as a practice for this
                                discipline, you’re going to break this arrow with your throat. I
                                then demonstrate how the steel point goes into the soft part of
                                your throat, while another person holds the other end of the
                                arrow against their outstretched palm. The idea is to walk
                                straight into the arrow and break it using only your throat
                                before it pierces through your neck.
                                At this point most people are in shock! Sometimes I pick
                                one volunteer to do this exercise, sometimes I hand out arrows
                                to everyone. I’ve done audiences where over a thousand
                                people are breaking arrows!
                                Can this feat be accomplished? Yes. Is it scary? You bet. Is
                                it uncomfortable? Absolutely. But again, the idea is that fear
                                and discomfort do not stop you. The idea is to practice, to
                                train yourself to do whatever it takes, and to act in spite of
                                anything that might be in your way.
                                Do most people break the arrow? Yes, everyone who walks
                                into it with 100 percent commitment breaks it. However, those
                                who walk into it slowly, halfheartedly, or not at all, don’t.
                                After the arrow exercise I ask people, “How many of you
                                found the arrow easier to break physically than what your
                                174 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                mind made it up to be?” All agree it was actually a lot easier
                                than they thought it would be. Why is this so? Here comes one
                                of the most important lessons you will ever learn.
                                Your mind is the greatest soap-opera scriptwriter in history.
                                It makes up incredible stories, usually based in dramas and
                                disasters, of things that never happened and probably never
                                will. Mark Twain said it best: “I’ve had thousands of problems
                                in my life, most of which never actually happened.”
                                One of the most important things you can ever understand
                                is that you are not your mind. You are much bigger and greater
                                than your mind alone. Your mind is a part of you just as your
                                hand is a part of you.
                                Here’s a thought-provoking question: What if you had a
                                hand that was just like your mind? It was scattered all over the
                                place, it was always beating you up, and it never shut up. What
                                would you do with it? Most people answer something like
                                “Cut it off !” But your hand is a powerful tool, so why would
                                you cut it off ? The real answer of course is you’d want to
                                control it, manage it, and train it to work for you instead of
                                against you.
                                Training and managing your own mind is the most important skill you
                                could ever own, in terms of both happiness and success, and that’s
                                exactly what we’ve been doing with this book and will
                                continue to do with you should you attend one of our live
                                programs.

                                How do you train your mind? You start with observation.
                                Notice how your mind consistently produces thoughts that are
                                not supportive to your wealth and happiness. As you identify
                                those thoughts, you can begin to consciously replace those
                                nonempowering thoughts with empowering ones. Where do
                                you find these empowering ways of thinking? Right here, in
                                this book. Every one of the declarations in this book is an
                                empowering and successful way of thinking.
                                Adopt these ways of thinking, being, and attitudes as your
                                own. You don’t have to wait for a formal invitation. Decide
                                right now that your life would be better if you chose to think
                                in the ways we’ve been describing in this book, instead of
                                through the self-defeating mental habits of the past. Make a
                                decision that from now on, your thoughts do not run you, you
                                run your thoughts. From now on, your mind is not the captain
                                of the ship, you are the captain of the ship, and your mind
                                works for you.
                                You can choose your thoughts.
                                You have the natural ability to cancel any thought that is
                                not supporting you, at any time. You can also install selfempowering thoughts at any
                                time, simply by choosing to focus
                                on them. You have the power to control your mind.
                                As I mentioned earlier, at one of my seminars one of my
                                closest friends and best-selling author Robert Allen said
                                something quite profound: “No thought lives in your head
                                rent-free.”
                                What that means is that you will pay for negative thoughts.
                                You will pay in money, in energy, in time, in health, and in
                                your level of happiness. If you want to quickly move to a new
                                level of life, begin dividing your thoughts into one of two
                                categories—empowering or disem-
                                176 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                powering. Observe the thoughts you have, and determine if
                                they are supportive to your happiness and success or not
                                supportive. Then choose to entertain only empowering
                                thoughts while refusing to focus on disempowering ones.
                                When a nonsupportive thought bubbles up, say “Cancel” or
                                “Thank you for sharing” and replace it with a more supportive
                                way of thinking. I call this process power thinking, and mark
                                my words, if you practice it, your life will never be the same
                                again. That is a promise!
                                So what is the difference between “power thinking” and
                                “positive” thinking? The distinction is slight but profound. To
                                me, people use positive thinking to pretend that everything is
                                rosy, when they really believe that it’s not. With power
                                thinking, we understand that everything is neutral, that nothing
                                has meaning except for the meaning we give it, and that we are
                                going to make up a story and give something its meaning.
                                This is the difference between positive thinking and power
                                thinking. With positive thinking, people believe that their
                                thoughts are true. Power thinking recognizes that our thoughts
                                are not true, but since we’re making up a story anyway, we
                                might as well make up a story that supports us. We don’t do
                                this because our new thoughts are “true” in an absolute sense,
                                but because they are more useful to us and feel a heck of a lot
                                better than nonsupportive ones.
                                Before we leave this section, I must warn you—do not attempt the arrow-break exercise at
                                home. The exercise has to
                                be set up in a specific way or you could hurt yourself as well as
                                others around you. At our programs we use protective
                                equipment. If you have an interest in these types of breakthrough exercises, see the

                                write down what you would do if the situation you fear
                                actually happened. Could you still survive? Could you
                                make a comeback? Chances are that the answers are yes.

                                people you normally wouldn’t speak to, ask for a raise in
                                your job or raise your prices in your business, wake up an

                                port your happiness and success. Challenge the little voice in
                                your head whenever it tells you “I can’t” or “I don’t want to”
                                or “I don’t feel like it.” Don’t allow this fear-based, comfortbased voice to get the
                                better of you. Make a pact with yourself
                                that whenever the voice tries to stop you from doing
                                something that would be supportive to your success, you will
                                do it anyway, to show your mind that you are the boss, not it.
                                Not only will you increase your confidence dramatically, but
                                eventually this voice will get quieter and quieter as it
                                recognizes it has little effect on you.
                                Success Story from Andrew Wilton
                                Harv,
                                My name is Andrew Wilton and I am eighteen years old. I
                                have just completed my first year of university. I attended
                                the Millionaire Mind Intensive two years ago and I have
                                been using the techniques I learned there ever since.
                                This past February for reading week, while my friends
                                were working or visiting their families, using the money that
                                I had saved through your methods, I was able to spend ten
                                days on the southern coast of Spain. What an experience!
                                I wouldn’t have had the financial freedom to go wherever
                                I wanted and do whatever I wanted if I hadn’t implemented
                                the strategies I learned at the MMI.
                                Thank you, Harv.</p>

                            <p>At the beginning of my live seminars, I introduce people to
                                what I call “the three most dangerous words in the English
                                language.” Those words are “I know that.” So how do you
                                know if you know something? Simple. If you live it, you know
                                it. Otherwise, you heard about it, you read about it, or you talk
                                about it, but you don’t know it. Put bluntly, if you’re not really
                                rich and really happy, there’s a good chance you still have
                                some things to learn about money, success, and life.
                                As I explained at the beginning of this book, during my
                                “broke” days, I was fortunate to get some advice from a multimillionaire friend who had
                                some compassion for my plight.
                                Remember what he said to me: “Harv, if you’re not as successful as you’d like to be,
                                there’s something you don’t know.”
                                Fortunately, I took his suggestion to heart and went from
                                being a “know-it-all” to a “learn-it-all.” From that moment on,
                                everything changed.
                                Poor people are often trying to prove that they’re right.
                                They put on a mask as if they’ve got it all figured out, and it’s
                                just some stroke of bad luck or a temporary glitch in the
                                universe that has them broke or struggling.
                                One of my more famous lines is “You can be right or you
                                can be rich, but you can’t be both.” Being “right” means having to hold on to your old
                                ways of thinking and being. Unfortunately, these are the ways that got you exactly where
                                you
                                are now. This philosophy also pertains to happiness, in that
                                “you can be right or you can be happy.”
                                180 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                You can be right or you can be rich,
                                but you can’t be both.
                                There’s a saying that author and speaker Jim Rohn uses that
                                makes perfect sense here: “If you keep doing what you’ve
                                always done, you’ll keep getting what you’ve always got.” You
                                already know “your” way, what you need is to know some new
                                ways. That’s why I wrote this book. My goal is to give you
                                some new mental files to add to the ones you already have.
                                New files mean new ways of thinking, new actions, and
                                therefore new results.
                                That’s why it’s imperative you continue to learn and grow.
                                Physicists agree that nothing in this world is static. Everything alive is constantly
                                changing. Take any plant. If a plant
                                isn’t growing, it is dying. It’s the same with people as well as all
                                other living organisms: if you are not growing, you are dying.
                                One of my favorite sayings is by author and philosopher
                                Eric Hoffer, who said, “The learners shall inherit the earth
                                while the learned will be beautifully equipped to live in a world
                                that no longer exists.” Another way of saying that is, if you’re
                                not continuously learning, you will be left behind.
                                Poor people claim they can’t afford to get educated due to
                                lack of time or money. On the other hand, rich people relate
                                to Benjamin Franklin’s quote: “If you think education is
                                expensive, try ignorance.” I’m sure you’ve heard this before,
                                “knowledge is power,” and power is the ability to act.
                                Whenever I offer the Millionaire Mind Intensive program, I
                                find it interesting that it’s usually the people who are
                                The Wealth Files - 181
                                the most broke who say, “I don’t need the course,” “I don’t
                                have the time,” or “I don’t have the money.” Meanwhile, the
                                millionaires and multimillionaires all register and say, “If I can
                                learn just one new thing or make one improvement, it’s worth
                                it.” By the way, if you don’t have the time to do the things you
                                want to do or need to do, you’re most probably a modern
                                slave. And if you don’t have the money to learn how to be
                                successful, you probably need it more than anyone. I’m sorry,
                                but saying “I don’t have the money” just doesn’t cut it. When
                                will you have the money? What is going to be different a year
                                or two years or five years from now? Here’s the easy answer:
                                nothing! And you’ll be saying the exact same words again at
                                that time.
                                The only way I know for you to have the money you want is
                                to learn how to play the money game inside and out. You need
                                to learn the skills and strategies to accelerate your income, to
                                manage money, and to invest it effectively. The definition of
                                insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting
                                different results. Look, if what you’ve been doing were
                                working, you’d already be rich and happy. Anything else your
                                mind conjures up as a response is nothing more than an
                                excuse or justification.
                                I hate to be so in your face about it, but the way I see it,
                                that’s my job. I believe a good coach will always ask more of
                                you than you will ask of yourself. Otherwise, why the heck do
                                you need one? As a coach, my goal is to train you, inspire you,
                                encourage you, coax you, and have you observe, in full living
                                color, what is holding you back. In short, to do whatever it
                                takes to move you to the next level in your life. If I have to, I’ll
                                rip you apart and then piece you back together in a way that
                                works. I’ll do whatever it takes to make you ten times happier
                                and a hundred times as rich. If you’re looking

                                for Pollyanna, I’m not your guy. If you want to move quickly
                                and permanently, let’s continue.
                                Success is a learnable skill. You can learn to succeed at
                                anything. If you want to be a great golfer, you can learn how to
                                do it. If you want to be a great piano player, you can learn how
                                to do it. If you want to be truly happy, you can learn how to
                                do it. If you want to be rich, you can learn how to do it. It
                                doesn’t matter where you are right now. It doesn’t matter
                                where you are starting from. What matters is that you are
                                willing to learn.
                                One of my better-known quotes is “Every master was once
                                a disaster.” Here’s an example. A while ago, I had an Olympic
                                skier in my seminar. When I made that statement, he stood up
                                and asked to share. He was adamant, and for some reason I
                                thought he was going to vehemently disagree. To the contrary,
                                he told everyone the story of how when he was a kid, he was
                                the worst skier of all his buddies. How they sometimes
                                wouldn’t call him to go skiing with them because he was so
                                slow. To fit in, he went to the mountain early each weekend
                                and took lessons. Pretty soon he not only kept up with his
                                buddies, he surpassed them. He then got involved in the racing
                                club and learned from a top-ranked coach. His exact words
                                were “I might be a master skier now, but I definitely started
                                out as a disaster. Harv’s absolutely right. You can learn to
                                succeed at anything. I learned how to succeed at skiing, and
                                my next goal is to learn how to succeed with money!”

                                No one comes out of the womb a financial genius. Every
                                rich person learned how to succeed at the money game, and so
                                can you. Remember, your motto is, if they can do it, I can do

                                Becoming rich isn’t as much about getting rich financially as

                                get rich. I want to share a secret with you that few people
                                know: the fastest way to get rich and stay rich is to work on
                                developing you! The idea is to grow yourself into a “successful”
                                person. Again, your outer world is merely a reflection of your
                                inner world. You are the root; your results are the fruits.
                                There’s a saying I like: “You take yourself with you wherever you go.” If you grow
                                yourself to become a successful
                                person, in strength of character and mind, you will naturally be
                                successful in anything and everything you do. You will gain the
                                power of absolute choice. You will gain the inner power and
                                ability to choose any job, business, or investment arena and
                                know you’ll be a success. This is the essence of this book.
                                When you are a level 5 person, you get level 5 results. But if
                                you can grow into a level 10 person, you will get level 10
                                results.
                                Heed this warning, however. If you don’t do the inner work
                                on yourself, and somehow you make a lot of money, it would
                                most likely be a stroke of luck and there’s a good chance you’d
                                lose it. But if you become a successful “person” inside and out,
                                you’ll not only make it, you’ll keep it, grow it, and most
                                important, you’ll be truly happy.
                                Rich people understand the order to success is BE, DO,
                                HAVE.
                                Poor and middle-class people believe the order to success is
                                HAVE, DO, BE.
                                184 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                Poor and most middle-class people believe “If I have a lot of
                                money, then I could do what I want and I’d be a success.”
                                Rich people understand, “If I become a successful person, I
                                will be able to do what I need to do to have what I want, including a lot of money.”
                                Here’s something else only rich people know: the goal of
                                creating wealth is not primarily to have a lot of money, the
                                goal of creating wealth is to help you grow yourself into the
                                best person you can possibly be. In fact, that is the goal of all
                                goals, to grow yourself as a person. World-renowned singer
                                and actress Madonna was asked why she kept changing her
                                persona, her music, and her style every year. She responded
                                that music was her way to express her “self ” and that reinventing herself each year
                                forces her to grow into the kind of
                                person she wants to be.
                                In short, success is not a “what,” it’s a “who.” The good
                                news is that “who” you are is totally trainable and learnable. I
                                should know. By no means am I perfect or even close to it, but
                                when I look at who I am today as opposed to who I was
                                twenty years ago, I can see a direct correlation between “me
                                and my wealth” (or lack of it) then and “me and my wealth”
                                now. I learned my way to success and so can you. That’s why
                                I’m in the training business. I know from personal experience
                                that virtually any person can be trained to succeed. I was
                                trained to succeed, and now I’ve been able to train tens of
                                thousands of others to succeed. Training works!
                                I’ve found that another key difference between rich people
                                and poor and middle-class people is that rich people are experts
                                in their field. Middle-class people are mediocre in their field,
                                and poor people are poor in their field. How good are you at
                                what you do? How good are you at your job? How good are
                                you at your business? Do you want a totally

                                unbiased way of knowing? Look at your paycheck. That will
                                tell you everything. It’s simple: to get paid the best, you must be the
                                best.
                                WEALTH PRINCIPLE:
                                To get paid the best, you must be the best.
                                We recognize this principle in the professional sports world
                                every day. Generally, the best players in every sport earn the
                                most. They also make the most money on endorsements. This
                                same principle also holds true in both the business and
                                financial worlds. Whether you choose to be a business owner,
                                a professional, a network marketing distributor, whether you’re
                                in commissioned sales or a salaried job, whether you’re an
                                investor in real estate, stocks, or anything else, all things being
                                equal: the better you are at it, the more you’ll earn. This is just
                                another reason why being a continuous learner and enhancing
                                your skill in whatever arena you are in is imperative.
                                On the topic of learning, it’s worth noting that rich people
                                not only continue to learn, they make sure they learn from
                                those who have already been where they themselves want to
                                go. One of the things that made the biggest difference for me
                                personally was whom I learned from. I always made it a point
                                to learn from true masters in their respective fields—not those
                                who claimed to be experts, but those who had real-world results to back up their talk.
                                Rich people take advice from people who are richer than
                                they are. Poor people take advice from their friends, who are
                                just as broke as they are.
                                I recently had a meeting with an investment banker who
                                186 - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
                                wanted to do business with me. He was suggesting I place
                                several hundred thousand dollars with him to get started. He
                                then asked me to forward him my financial statements so he
                                could make his recommendations.
                                I looked him in the eye and said, “Excuse me, but don’t you
                                have this backward? If you want me to hire you to handle my
                                money, wouldn’t it be more appropriate for you to forward me
                                your financial statements? And if you’re not really rich, don’t
                                bother!” The man was in shock. I could tell that no one had
                                ever questioned his own net worth as a stipulation for
                                investing with him.
                                It’s absurd. If you were going to climb Mount Everest,
                                would you hire a guide who’s never been to the summit before, or would it be smarter to
                                find someone who’s made it to
                                the top several times and knows exactly how to do it?
                                So, yes, I am absolutely suggesting you put serious attention
                                and energy into continuously learning and, at the same time, be
                                cautious of whom you are learning and taking advice from. If
                                you learn from those who are broke, even if they’re
                                consultants, coaches, or planners, there’s only one thing they
                                can teach you—how to be broke!
                                By the way, I highly recommend you consider hiring a
                                personal success coach. A good coach will keep you on track
                                in doing what you’ve said you want to do. Some coaches are
                                “life” coaches, meaning they handle the gamut of everything,
                                while other coaches have specialties that might include personal or professional
                                performance, finances, business, relationships, health, and even spirituality. Again,
                                find out your
                                prospective coach’s background to ensure the coach has
                                demonstrated success in the arenas of importance to you.
                                Just as there are successful paths to climbing Mount Everest, there are proven routes
                                and strategies for creating high
                                The Wealth Files - 187
                                income, fast financial freedom, and wealth. You have to be
                                willing to learn them and use them.
                                Again, as part of our Millionaire Mind Money Management
                                method, I strongly suggest that you put 10 percent of your
                                income into an Education Fund. Use this money specifically
                                for courses, books, tapes, CDs, or any other way you choose
                                to educate yourself, whether through the formal education
                                system, private training companies, or personalized, one-onone coaching. Whatever method
                                you choose, this fund ensures
                                you will always have the wherewithal to learn and grow instead
                                of repeating the poor person’s refrain of “I already know.”
                                The more you learn, the more you earn . . . and you can take
                                that to the bank!
                                DECLARATION: Place your hand on your heart and say...
                                “I am committed to constantly learning and growing.”
                                Touch your head and say...
                                “I have a millionaire mind!”
